<h2>PUBLISHER'S PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Time out of mind, words prefatory have been considered
indispensable to the successful publication of a book. This
sketch of the <span class="smcap">Life</span> and <span class="smcap">Death</span> of <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span> is intended
as an accompaniment to the Historical Painting which
has rescued from oblivion, and, with almost perfect fidelity,
transmitted to futurity, "<span class="smcap">The Last Hours of Lincoln</span>." In
its preparation has been invoked the aid of one who in life
was near the heart of <span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>, and at death was a
witness to that last sad scene, so accurately delineated by
the painter's art&mdash;the Hon. <span class="smcap">Isaac N. Arnold</span>. His intimate
and social relations with <span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>, his unbounded admiration
of the goodness and sincerity of the Great Emancipator,
renders this invocation eminently appropriate. This sketch
contains subject-matter never before made public, presented
in the full dress of the author's happiest style.</p>

<p>In confident reliance upon the affection of the people for
the great Apostle of Liberty&mdash;the Martyr&mdash;who in his blood
wrote his belief "that all men everywhere should be free,"
this sketch is submitted.</p>

<h2>SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</h2>

<p>Modern history furnishes no life more eventful and
important, terminated by a death so dramatic, as that of
the Martyr President. Poetry and painting, sculpture and
eloquence, have all sought to illustrate his career, but the
grand epic poem of his life has yet to be written. We
are too near him in point of time, fully to comprehend
and appreciate his greatness and the vast influence he is
to exert upon the world. The storms which marked his
tempestuous political career have not yet entirely subsided,
and the shock of his fearfully tragic death is still
felt; but as the dust and smoke of war pass away, and
the mists of prejudice which filled the air during the
great conflict clear up, his character will stand out in
bolder relief and more perfect outline.</p>

<p>The ablest and most sincere apostle of liberty the
world has ever seen was Abraham Lincoln. He was a
Christian statesman, with faith in God and man. The two
men, whose pre-eminence in American history the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
will ever recognize, are Washington and Lincoln. The
Republic which the first founded and the latter saved, has
already crowned them as models for her children.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln was born, February 12th, 1809, in
Hardin County, in the Slave State of Kentucky.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> When the compiler of the Annals of Congress asked Mr. Lincoln to furnish him
with data from which to compile a sketch of his life, the following brief, characteristic
statement was given. It contrasts very strikingly with the voluminous biographies
furnished by some small great men who have been in Congress:&mdash;

<p>His father Thomas and his grandfather Abraham were
born in Rockingham County, Virginia. His ancestors were
from Pennsylvania, and were Friends or Quakers. The
grandfather after whom he was named, went early to
Kentucky, and was murdered by the Indians, while at
work upon his farm. The early and fearful conflicts in
the dense forests of Kentucky, between the settlers and
the Indians, gave to a portion of that beautiful State the
name of the "<i>dark and bloody ground</i>." The subject of
this sketch was the son, the grandson, and the great
grandson of a pioneer. His ancestors had settled on the
border, first in Pennsylvania, then in Virginia, and from
thence to Kentucky. His grandfather had four sons and
two daughters. Thomas the youngest son was the father
of Abraham, and his life was a struggle with poverty,
a hard-working man with very limited education. He
could barely sign his name. In the twenty-eighth year
of his age he married Nancy Hanks, a native of Virginia,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>she was one of those plain, dignified matrons, possessing
a strong physical organization, and great common sense,
with deep religious feeling, and the utmost devotion to
her family and children, such as are not unusual in the
early settlements of our country. Reared on the frontier,
where life was a struggle, she could use the rifle and the
implements of agriculture as well as the distaff and spinning-wheel.
She was one of those strong, self-reliant
characters, yet gentle in manners, often found in the
humbler walks of life, fitted as well to command the respect,
as the love of all to whom she was known. Abraham
had a brother older, and a sister younger than himself,
but both died many years before he reached distinction.</p>

<p>In 1816, when he was only eight years old, the family
removed to Spenser County, Indiana. The first tool the boy
of the backwoods learns to use is the ax. This, young
Lincoln, strong and athletic beyond his years, had learned
to handle with some effect, even at that early age, and he
began from this period to be of important service to his
parents in cutting their way to, and building up, a home
in the forests.</p>

<p>A feat with the rifle soon after this period shows that he
was not unaccustomed to its use: seeing a flock of wild
turkeys approaching, the lad seized his father's rifle and
succeeded in shooting one through a crack of his father's
cabin.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1818 his mother died. Her death was
to her family, and especially her favorite son Abraham, an
irreparable loss. Although she died when in his tenth year,
she had already deeply impressed upon him those elements
of character which were the foundation of his greatness;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
perfect truthfulness, inflexible honesty, love of justice and
respect for age, and reverence for God. He ever spoke of
her with the most touching affection. "All that I am, or
hope to be," said he, "I owe to my angel mother."</p>

<p>It was his mother who taught him to read and write; from
her he learned to read the Bible, and this book he read and
re-read in youth, because he had little else to read, and later
in life because he believed it was the word of God, and the
best guide of human conduct. It was very rare to find, even
among clergymen, any so familiar with it as he, and few
could so readily and accurately quote its text.</p>

<p>There is something very affecting in the incident that this
boy&mdash;whom his mother had found time amidst her weary
toil and the hard struggle of her rude life, to teach to write
legibly, should find the first occasion of putting his knowledge
of the pen to practical use, was in writing a letter to a
traveling preacher, imploring him to come and perform religious
services over his mother's grave. The preacher, a Mr.
Elkin, came, though not immediately, traveling many miles
on horseback through the wild forests; and some months
after her death the family and neighbors gathered around the
tree beneath which they had laid her, to perform the simple,
solemn funeral rites. Hymns were sung, prayers said, and
an address pronounced over her grave. The impression made
upon young Lincoln by his mother was as lasting as life.
Love of truth, reverence for religion, perfect integrity, were
ever associated in his mind with the tenderest love and respect
for her. His father subsequently married Mrs. Sally
Johnson, of Kentucky, a widow with three children.</p>

<p>In March, 1830, the family removed to Illinois, and settled
in Macon County, near Decatur. Here he assisted his father
to build a log-cabin; clear, fence, and plant, a few acres of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
land; and then, being now twenty-one years of age, he asked
permission to seek his own fortune. He began by going out
to work by the month, breaking up the prairie, splitting and
chopping cord wood, and any thing he could find to do. His
father not long afterward removed to Coles County, Illinois,
where he lived until 1851, dying at the age of seventy-three.
He lived to see his son Abraham one of the most distinguished
men in the State, and received from him many
memorials of his affection and kindness. His son often sent
money to his father and other members of his family, and
always treated them, however poor and illiterate, with the
kindest consideration.</p>

<p>It is clear from his own declarations that he early cherished
an ambition, probably under the inspiration of his
mother, to rise to a higher position. He had in all less than
one year's attendance at school, but his mother having taught
him to read and write, with an industry, application, and
perseverance untiring, he applied himself to all the means of
improvement within his reach. Fortunately, providentially,
the Bible has been everywhere and always present in every
cabin and home in the land. The influence of this book
formed his character; he was able to obtain in addition to
the Bible, &AElig;sop's Fables, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Weems'
Life of Washington, and Burns' Poems. These constituted
nearly all he read before he reached the age of nineteen.
Living on the frontier, mingling with the rude, hard-working,
honest, and virtuous backwoodsmen, he became expert in the
use of every implement of agriculture and woodcraft, and as
an ax-man he had no superior.</p>

<p>His days were spent in hard manual labor, and his
evenings in study; he grew up free from idleness, and contracted
no stain of intemperance, profanity, or vice; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
drank no intoxicating liquors, nor did he use tobacco in
any form.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that while residing at New Salem,
Mr. Lincoln entertained a boy's fancy for a prairie beauty
named Ann Rutledge. Mr. Irving, in his life of Washington,
says: "Before he (Washington) was fifteen years of age,
he had conceived a passion for some unknown beauty, so
serious as to disturb his otherwise well-regulated mind,
and to make him really unhappy." Some romance has been
published in regard to this early attachment of Lincoln,
and gossip and imagination have converted a simple, boyish
fancy, such as few reach manhood without having passed
through, into a "grand passion." It has been produced in
a form altogether too dramatic and highly-colored for the
truth. The idea that this fancy had any permanent influence
upon his life and character is purely imaginary. No
man was ever a more devoted and affectionate husband
and father than he.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1832 Lincoln volunteered as a private
in a company of soldiers raised by the Governor of Illinois,
for what is known as the Black Hawk War. He was
elected captain of the company, and served during the campaign,
but had no opportunity of meeting the enemy.</p>

<p>Soon after his return he was nominated for the State
Legislature, and in the precinct in which he resided, out
of 284 votes received all but seven. It was while a resident
of New Salem that he became a practical surveyor.</p>

<p>Up to this period the life of Lincoln had been one of
labor, hardship, and struggle: his shelter had been the log-cabin;
his food, the "<i>corn dodger and common doings</i>,"<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>game of the forests and the prairie, and the products of
the farm; his dress, the Kentucky jean and buckskin of
the frontier; the tools with which he labored, the ax, the
hoe, and the plow. He had made two trips to New Orleans;
these and his soldiering in the Black Hawk War showed
his fondness for adventure.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The settlers have an expression, "Corn dodger and common doin's," as contradistinguished
from "Wheat bread and chickin fixin's."</p></div>

<p>Thus far he had been a backwoodsman, a rail-splitter, a
flatboatman, a clerk, a captain of volunteers, a surveyor. In
1834 he was elected to the Legislature of Illinois, receiving
the highest vote of any one on the ticket. He was re-elected
in 1836 (the term being for two years). At this session he
met, as a fellow-member, Stephen A. Douglas, then representing
Morgan County.</p>

<p>He remained a member of the Legislature for eight
years, and then declined being again a candidate.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court of
Illinois in the autumn of 1836, and his name first appears
on the roll of attorneys in 1837.</p>

<p>In April of this year he removed to Springfield, and
soon after entered into partnership with his friend, John
T. Stewart. As a lawyer he early manifested, in a wonderful
degree, the power of simplifying and making clear
to the common understanding the most difficult and abstruse
questions.</p>

<p>The circuit practice&mdash;"riding the circuit" it was called&mdash;as
conducted in Illinois thirty years ago, was admirably
adapted to educate, develop, and discipline all there was in
a man of intellect and character. Few books could be obtained
upon the circuit, and no large libraries for consultation
could be found anywhere. A mere case lawyer was a
helpless child in the hands of the intellectual giants produced
by these circuit-court contests, where novel questions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
were constantly arising, and must be immediately settled
upon principle and analogy.<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Vide "History of Abraham Lincoln and the Overthrow of Slavery," p. 76.</p></div>

<p>A few elementary books, such as Blackstone's and Kent's
Commentaries, Chitty's Pleadings, and Starkie's Evidence,
could sometimes be found, or an odd volume would be
carried along with the scanty wardrobe of the attorney in
his saddle-bags. These were studied until the text was as
familiar as the alphabet. By such aid as these afforded,
and the application of principles, were all the complex
questions which arose settled. Thirty years ago it was the
practice of the leading members of the bar to follow
the judge from county to county. The court-houses were
rude log buildings, with slab benches for seats, and the
roughest pine tables. In these, when courts were in session,
Lincoln could be always found, dressed in Kentucky jean,
and always surrounded by a circle of admiring friends&mdash;always
personally popular with the judges, the lawyers, the
jury, and the spectators. His wit and humor, his power
of illustration by apt comparison and anecdote, his power
to ridicule by ludicrous stories and illustrations, were
inexhaustible.</p>

<p>He always aided by his advice and counsel the young
members of the bar. No embarrassed tyro in the profession
ever sought his assistance in vain, and it was not
unusual for him, if his adversary was young and inexperienced,
kindly to point out to him formal errors in his
pleadings and practice. His manner of conducting jury
trials was very effective.</p>

<p>He was familiar, frequently colloquial: at the summer
terms of the courts, he would often take off his coat, and
leaning carelessly on the rail of the jury box, would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>single out and address a leading juryman, in a conversational
way, and with his invariable candor and fairness
would proceed to reason the case. When he was satisfied
that he had secured the favorable judgment of the
juryman so addressed, he would turn to another, and address
him in the same manner, until he was convinced the
jury were with him. There were times when aroused by
injustice, fraud, or some great wrong or falsehood, when
his denunciation was so crushing that the object of it
was driven from the court-room.</p>

<p>There was a latent power in him which when aroused
was literally overwhelming. This power was sometimes
exhibited in political debate, and there were occasions
when it utterly paralyzed his opponent. His replies to
Douglas, at Springfield and Peoria, in 1858, were illustrations
of this power. His examination and cross-examination
of witnesses were very happy and effective. He
always treated those who were disposed to be truthful
with respect.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln's professional bearing was so high, he was
so courteous and fair that no man ever questioned his
truthfulness or his honor. No one who watched him for
half an hour in court in an important case ever doubted
his ability. He understood human nature well; and read
the character of party, jury, witnesses, and attorneys, and
knew how to address and influence them. Probably as
a jury lawyer, on the right side, he has never had his
superior.</p>

<p>Such was Mr. Lincoln at the bar, a fair, honest, able
lawyer, on the right side irresistible, on the wrong comparatively
weak.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h2>MR. LINCOLN FROM HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE
TO HIS ELECTION TO CONGRESS.</h2>

<p>A friend and associate of Mr. Lincoln, speaking of him,
as he was in 1840, says: "They mistake greatly who regard
him as an uneducated man. In the physical sciences
he was remarkably well read. In scientific mechanics,
and all inventions and labor-saving machinery, he was
thoroughly informed. He was one of the best practical
surveyors in the State. He understood the general principles
of botany, geology, and astronomy, and had a great
treasury of practical useful knowledge."</p>

<p>He continued to acquire knowledge and to grow intellectually
until his death, and became one of the most intelligent
and best-informed men in public life.</p>

<p>Early in life he became an anti-slavery man, as well from
the impulses of his heart as the convictions of his reason.
He always had an intense hatred of oppression in every form,
and an honest, earnest faith in the common people, and his
sympathies were ever with the oppressed. The most conspicuous
traits of his character were love of justice and love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of truth. It is false, very arrogant, and to those who knew
Lincoln in his earlier years, it is very amusing, for any man or
set of men to assume to himself or themselves the credit of
having inspired him with hatred of slavery. No man was
less influenced by others in coming to his conclusions than he;
and this was especially true in regard to questions involving
right and justice. His own heart, his own observation, his
own clear intellect led him to become an anti-slavery man.
Long before he plead the cause of the slave before the American
people, he said to a friend,<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "It is strange that while our
courts decide that a man does not lose his title to his property
by its being stolen, but he may reclaim it whenever he can
find it, yet if he himself is stolen he instantly loses his right
to himself!"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Hon. Jos. Gillespie.</p></div>

<p>In November, 1842, he was married to Miss Mary Todd,
daughter of the Hon. Robert S. Todd, of Kentucky. The
mother of Mrs. Lincoln died when she was young. She had
sisters living at Springfield, Illinois. Visiting them, she made
the acquaintance and won the heart of Mr. Lincoln. They
had four children, Robert, Edward (who died in infancy), William,
and Thomas. Robert and Thomas survive. William, a
beautiful and promising boy, died at Washington, during his
father's presidency. Mr. Lincoln was a most fond, tender, and
affectionate husband and father. No man was ever more
faithful and true in his domestic relations.</p>

<h2>LINCOLN IN CONGRESS.</h2>

<p>On the 6th of December, 1847, Mr. Lincoln took his seat
in Congress. Mr. Douglas, who had already run a brilliant
career in the lower House of Congress, at this same session
took his seat in the Senate. Mr. Lincoln distinguished himself
by able speeches upon the Mexican War, upon Internal
Improvements, and by one of the most effective campaign
speeches of that Congress in favor of the election of General
Taylor to the Presidency. He proposed a bill for the abolition
of slavery at the National capital. He declined a re-election,
and was succeeded by his friend, the eloquent E. D.
Baker, who was killed at Ball's Bluff.</p>

<p>In 1852, he lead the electoral ticket of Illinois in favor
of General Scott for President. Franklin Pierce was elected,
and Mr. Lincoln remained quietly engaged in his professional
pursuits until the repeal of the Missouri Compromise in 1854.
This event was the beginning of the end of slavery. "It
thoroughly roused the people of the Free States to a realization
of the progress and encroachments of the slave power,
and the necessity of preserving 'the jewel of freedom.'"
From that hour the conflict went on between freedom and
slavery, first by the ballot, and all the agencies by which public
opinion is influenced, and then the slave-holders, seeing that
their supremacy was departing, sought by arms to overthrow
the government which they could no longer control.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln, while a strong opponent of slavery, had up to
this time rested in the hope that by peaceful agencies it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in the course of ultimate extinction. But now seeing the vast
strides it was making, he became convinced its progress must
be arrested or that it would dominate over the republic, and
Slavery would become "lawful in all the States." From this
time he gave himself with solemn earnestness to the cause of
liberty and his country. He forgot himself in his great cause.
He did not seek place, if the great cause could be better advanced
by the promotion of another; hence his promotion of
the election of Trumbull to the United States Senate.</p>

<p>This unselfish devotion to principle was a great source
of his power. Placing himself at the head of those who
opposed the extension of, and who believed in the moral
wrong of slavery, he entered upon his great mission with
a singleness of purpose, an eloquence and power, which
made him as the advocate of freedom, the most effective
and influential speaker who ever addressed the American
people.</p>

<p>He brought to the tremendous struggle between freedom
and slavery physical strength and endurance almost
superhuman. Notwithstanding his modesty and the absence
of all self-assertion, when we review the conflict
from 1854 to 1865, when the struggle closed by the adoption
of the constitutional amendment abolishing and prohibiting
slavery forever throughout the republic, it is
clear that Lincoln's speeches and writings did more to accomplish
this result than any other agency.</p>

<p>Following the repeal of the Missouri Compromise came
the Kansas struggle, and the organization of a great party
to resist the encroachments and aggressions of slavery.
The people instinctively found the leader of such a party
in Lincoln.</p>

<p>Looking over the whole ground, with the sagacity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which marked his far-seeing mind, he saw that the basis
upon which to build were the grand principles of the
Declaration of Independence. This foundation was broad
enough to include old-fashioned Democrats who sympathized
with Jefferson in his hatred of slavery; Whigs
who had learned their love of liberty from the utterances
of the Adamses and Channings, and the earlier
speeches of Webster; and anti-slavery men, who recognized
Chase and Sumner as their leaders.</p>

<p>He now addressed himself to the work of consolidating
out of all these elements a party, the distinctive
characteristics of which should be the full recognition of
the principles of the Declaration of Independence and hostility
to the extension of Slavery. This was the party
which in 1856 gave John C. Fremont 114 electoral
votes for President, and in 1860, elected Lincoln to the
executive chair.</p>

<h2>THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATE.</h2>

<p>In the midsummer of 1858, Senator Douglas, whose term
approached its close, came home to canvass for re-election.
It was in the midst of the Kansas struggle, and
although he had broken with the administration of Buchanan,
because he resisted the admission of Kansas into the
Union, under the fraudulent Lecompton Constitution, and
insisted that the people of that State, should enjoy the
right by a fair vote, of deciding upon the character of
their Constitution,<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> yet the people of Illinois did not
forget that he was chiefly responsible for the repeal of
the Missouri Compromise, and that he had indorsed the
Dred Scott decision. On the 17th of June, 1858, the
Republican State Convention of Illinois met and by acclamation
nominated Mr. Lincoln for the Senate. He was
unquestionably more indebted to Douglas for his greatness
than to any other person.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> That they "should be perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions
in their own way."</p></div>

<p>In 1856 Lincoln said, "Twenty years ago Judge
Douglas and I first became acquainted; we were both
young then, he a trifle younger than I. Even then we
were both ambitious, I perhaps quite as much as he.
With me the race of ambition has proved a flat failure;
with him it has been one of splendid success. His name
fills the nation, and it is not unknown in foreign lands.
I affect no contempt for the high eminence he has reached;
so reached that the oppressed of my species might have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>shared with me in the elevation, I would rather stand
on that eminence than wear the richest crown that ever
pressed a monarch's brow."</p>

<p>Ten years had not gone by, before the modest Lincoln,
then so humbly expressing this noble sentiment, and to
whom at that moment "The race of ambition seemed a
flat failure;" ten years had not passed, ere he had reached
an eminence on which his name filled, not a nation only,
but the world; and he had indeed so reached it, that
the oppressed did share with him in the elevation; and
so far had he passed his then great rival, that the name
of Douglas will be carried down to posterity, chiefly because
of its association as a competitor with Lincoln.</p>

<p>But in many particulars Douglas was not an unworthy
competitor. The contest between these two champions
was perhaps the most remarkable in American history.
They were the acknowledged leaders, each of his party.
Douglas had been a prominent candidate for the presidency,
was well known and personally popular, not only in the
West, but throughout the Union. Both were men of great
and marked individuality of character. The immediate
prize was the Senatorship of the great State of Illinois,
and, in the future, the presidency. The result would largely
influence the struggle for freedom in Kansas, and the
question of slavery throughout the Union. The canvass
attracted the attention of the people everywhere, and the
speeches were reported and published, not only in the
leading papers in the State, but reporters were sent from
most of the large cities, to report the incidents of the
debates, and describe the conflict.</p>

<p>Douglas was at this time unquestionably the leading
debater in the United States Senate. For years he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
been accustomed to meet the great leaders of the nation
in Congress, and he had rarely been discomfited. He had
contended with Jefferson Davis, and Toombs, and Hunter,
and with Chase, and Sumner, and Seward; and his friends
claimed that he was the equal, if not the superior, of the
ablest. He was fertile in resources, severe in denunciation,
familiar with political history, and had participated so many
years in Congressional debate, that he handled with readiness
and facility all the weapons of political controversy.
Of indomitable physical and moral courage, he was certainly
among the most formidable men in the nation on the stump.
In Illinois, where he had hosts of friends and enthusiastic
followers, he possessed a power over the masses unequaled
by any other man, a most striking exhibition of which was
exhibited in this canvass, in which he held to himself the
whole Democratic party of the State. The administration
of Buchanan, with all its patronage wielded by the
wily and unscrupulous Slidell, and running a separate
ticket, was able to detach only 5,000 out of 126,000 votes
from him. There was something exciting, something which
stirred the blood, in the boldness with which he threw himself
into the conflict, and dealt his blows right and left
against the Republican party on one side, and the administration
of Buchanan, which sought his defeat, on the other.</p>

<p>Two men presenting more striking contrasts, physically,
intellectually, and morally, could not anywhere be found.
Douglas was a short, sturdy, resolute man, with large head
and chest, and short legs; his ability had gained for him
the appellation of "The little giant of Illinois."</p>

<p>Lincoln was of the Kentucky type of men, very tall,
long-limbed, angular, awkward in gait and attitude, physically
a real giant, large-featured, his eyes deep-set under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
heavy eyebrows, his forehead high and retreating, with
heavy, dark hair.</p>

<p>Their style of speaking, like every thing about them,
was in striking contrast. Douglas, skilled by a thousand
conflicts in all the strategy of a face to face encounter,
stepped upon the platform and faced the thousands of
friends and foes around him with an air of conscious
power. There was an air of indomitable pluck, sometimes
something approaching impudence in his manner, when he
looked out on the immense throngs which surged and
struggled before him. Lincoln was modest, but always
self-possessed, with no self-consciousness, his whole mind
evidently absorbed in his great theme, always candid,
truthful, cool, logical, accurate; at times, inspired by his
subject, rising to great dignity and wonderful power. The
impression made by Douglas, upon a stranger who saw
him for the first time on the platform, would be&mdash;"that
is a bold, audacious, ready debater, an ugly opponent."
Of Lincoln&mdash;"There is a candid, truthful, sincere man, who,
whether right or wrong, believes he is right." Lincoln
argued the side of freedom, with the most thorough conviction
that on its triumph depended the fate of the
Republic. An idea of the impression made by Lincoln
in these discussions may be inferred from a remark made
by a plain old Quaker, who, at the close of the Ottawa
debate, said: "Friend, doubtless God <i>Almighty might</i> have
made an honester man than Abe Lincoln, but doubtless
he never did." It is curious that the cause of freedom was
plead by a Kentuckian, and that of slavery by a native
of Vermont. Forgetful of the ancestral hatred of slavery
to which he had been born, Douglas had, by marriage,
become a slave-holder. Lincoln had one great advantage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
over his antagonist&mdash;he was always good-humored; while
Douglas sometimes lost his temper, Lincoln never lost his.</p>

<p>The great champions in these debates, and their discussions,
have passed into history, and the world has ratified
the popular verdict of the day&mdash;that Lincoln was the
victor. It should be remembered, in justice to the intellectual
power of Douglas, that Lincoln spoke for liberty,
and he was the organ of a new and vigorous party, with
a full consciousness of being in the right. Douglas was
looking to the presidency as well as the senatorship, and
must keep one eye on the slave-holder and the other on
the citizens of Illinois.</p>

<p>The debates in the old Continental Congress, and those
on the Missouri question of 1820-1, those of Webster and
Hayne, and Webster and Calhoun, are all historical; but
it may be doubted if either were more important than
these of Lincoln and Douglas.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln, although his party received a majority of the
popular vote was defeated for Senator, because certain Democratic
Senators held over from certain Republican districts.</p>

<p>On the 27th of February, 1860, Mr. Lincoln delivered his
celebrated Cooper Institute address. Many went to hear the
prairie orator, expecting to be entertained with noisy declamation,
extravagant and verbose, and with plenty of amusing
stories. The speech was so dignified, so exact in language
and statement, so replete with historical learning, it exhibited
such strength and grasp of thought and was so elevated in
tone, that the intelligent audience were astonished and
delighted. The closing sentence is characteristic, and should
never be forgotten by those who advocate the right. "Let
us have faith that <i>right</i> makes <i>might</i>, and in that faith let us
to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it."</p>

<h2>NOMINATION AND ELECTION AS PRESIDENT.</h2>

<p>When the National Convention met at Chicago in the
June following, to nominate a candidate for President, while
a majority of the delegates were divided among Messrs.
Seward, Chase, Cameron, and Bates, Mr. Lincoln was the first
choice of a large plurality, and the second choice of all;
besides he was personally so popular with the people, his
sobriquet of "Honest old Abe," "The Illinois Rail-splitter,"
satisfied the shrewd men who were studying the best means
of securing success, that he was the most available man to
head the ticket. These considerations made his nomination
a certainty from the beginning.</p>

<p>The nomination was hailed with enthusiasm throughout
the Union. Never did a party enter upon a canvass with
more zeal and energy. With the usual motives which
actuate political parties there were in this canvass mingled a
love of country, a devotion to liberty, a keen sense of the
wrongs and outrages inflicted upon the Free State men of
Kansas, which fired all hearts with enthusiasm. Mr. Lincoln
received one hundred and eighty electoral votes, Douglas
twelve, Breckinridge seventy-two, and John Bell of Tennessee,
thirty-nine. Mr. Lincoln received of the popular vote
1,866,452, a plurality, but not a majority of the whole.</p>

<p>By the election of Mr. Lincoln the executive power of the
republic passed from the slave-holders. Mr. Lincoln and the
great party who elected him contemplated no interference
with slavery in the States. They meant to prevent its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
further extension, but the slave-holders instinctively felt that
with the government in the hands of those who believed
slavery morally wrong, the end of slavery was a mere question
of time. Rather than yield, the slave aristocracy
resolved "to take up the sword," and hence the terrible civil
war.</p>

<p>On the 11th of February, 1861, Mr. Lincoln left his quiet
happy home at Springfield to enter upon that tempestuous
political career which was to lead him through a martyr's
grave to a deathless fame among the greatest and noblest
patriots and benefactors of mankind. With a dim, mysterious
foreshadowing of the future, he uttered to his friends
and neighbors who gathered around him to say good-bye, his
farewell. He seemed conscious that he might see the place
which had been his home for "a quarter of a century, and
where his children were born, and where one of them lay
buried" no more. Weighed down with the consciousness of
the great duties which devolved upon him, greater than those
devolving upon any President since Washington, he humbly
expressed his reliance upon Divine Providence, and asked his
friends to pray that he might receive the assistance of
"Almighty God." As he journeyed toward the capital,
received everywhere with the earnest sympathies of the
people, the loyal men of all parties assuring him of their
support, his spirits rose, and when he passed the State line
of his own State his hopefulness found expression in the
words "behind the cloud the sun is shining still." And on
he sped through the great Free States of the North. While
on his way to the capital the people were everywhere deeply
impressed by his modest yet firm reliance upon Providence.
He went forth not leaning on his own strength, but resting
on Almighty God.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early gray of the morning of the 23d of February,
1861, he came in sight of the dome of the Capitol, then filled
with traitors plotting his death and the overthrow of the
Government. By anticipating the train, by which it had
been publicly announced that he would pass through Baltimore,
and passing through that city at night he escaped a
deeply-laid conspiracy, which would otherwise have anticipated
the crime of Booth. None who witnessed will ever
forget the scene of his first inauguration.</p>

<p>The veteran Scott had gathered a few soldiers of the
Regular Army to preserve order and security; many Northern
citizens thronged the streets, few of them conscious of
the volcano of treason and murder seething beneath them.
The departments and public offices were full of plotting
traitors. Many of the rebel generals held commissions
under the Government they were about to desert and
betray. The ceremony of inauguration is always imposing;
on this occasion it was especially so. Buchanan, sad,
dejected, bowed with a seeming consciousness of duties
unperformed, rode with the President-elect to the Capitol.</p>

<p>There were gathered the Justices of the Supreme Court,
both Houses of Congress, the representatives of foreign
nations, and a vast concourse of citizens from all sections
of the Union. There were Chase, and Seward, and Sumner,
and Breckinridge, and Douglas, who was near the President,
and was observed eagerly looking over the crowd,
not unconscious of the personal danger of his great and
successful rival. Mr. Lincoln was so absorbed with the
gravity of the occasion and the condition of his country,
that he utterly forgot himself, and there was observed a
dignity, which sprung from a mind entirely engrossed with
public duties.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>He was perfectly cool, and stepping to the eastern
colonnade of the Capitol, that voice, which had been often
heard by tens of thousands on the prairies of the West,
now read in clear and ringing tones his inaugural. On
the threshold of war, he made a last appeal for peace.
He declared his fixed resolve, firm as the everlasting rocks:
"<i>I shall take care that the laws of the Union be faithfully
executed in every State</i>."</p>

<p>Yet his great, kind heart yearned for peace, and as he
approached the close, his voice faltered with emotion. "I
am loath to close," said he; "we are <i>not</i> enemies, but friends;
we must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained,
it must not break the bonds of affection. The mystic cords
of memory, stretching from every battle-field and patriot's
grave, to every living heart and hearthstone over all this
broad land, will yet swell with the chorus of the Union,
when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better
angels of our nature."</p>

<p>Alas! these appeals for peace were received by those
to whom they were addressed with coarse ribaldry, with
sneers and jeers, and all the savage and barbarous passions
which riot in blood. Lincoln was somewhat slow to learn
that it was to force only&mdash;stern, unflinching force&mdash;that treason
would yield.</p>

<p>And now opened that terrible civil war which has no
parallel in history. Space will not permit me to follow the
President through those long and terrible days of victory and
defeat, to final triumph. Through all, Lincoln was firm, constant,
hopeful, sagacious, wise, confiding always in God, and
in the people.</p>

<h2>THE THIRTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS.</h2>

<p>The special session of the Thirty-seventh Congress met
on the 4th of July, 1861, agreeably to the call of the
President. Many vacant chairs in the National Council
impressed the spectator with the magnitude of the impending
struggle. The old chiefs of the slave party were nearly
all absent, some of them as members of a rebel government
at Richmond, others in arms against their country. The
President calmly, clearly, sadly reviewed the facts which
compelled him to call into action the <i>war powers</i> of the
Government, and constrained him, as the Chief Magistrate,
"<i>to accept war</i>." He asked Congress to confer upon him
the power to make the war short and decisive. He asked
for 400,000 men and 400 millions of money. With hearty
appreciation of the fidelity of the common people, he
proudly points to the fact that, while large numbers of
the officers of the Army and Navy had been guilty of the
infamous crime of desertion, "not one common soldier or
sailor is known to have deserted his flag."</p>

<p>Congress responded promptly to this call, voting 500,000
men and 500 millions of dollars to suppress the rebellion.
From the beginning of the contest, the slaves flocked to the
Union army as a place of security from their masters. They
seemed to feel instinctively that freedom was to be found
within its picket-lines and under the folds of its flag. They
were ready to act as guides, as servants, to work, dig, and to
fight for their liberty. And yet early in the war some officers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
permitted masters and agents to follow the blacks into the
Union lines and carry away fugitive slaves. This action was
rebuked by a resolution of Congress. At this session a law
was passed giving freedom to all slaves employed in aiding
the rebellion. In October, 1861, the military was authorized
by the Secretary of War to avail itself of the services of
"fugitives from labor," in such way as might be most beneficial
to the service.</p>

<p>The regular session of Congress assembled on the 2d of
December, 1861. Great armies confronted each other in the
field; and great conflicts were going on in the public mind,
but the way to victory through emancipation was not yet
clearly opened. The President was feeling his way, watching
the progress of public opinion; striving to secure to the Union
the Border States of Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. On
the subject of Emancipation, he said in his message: "the
Union must be preserved, and all <i>indispensable means</i> must
be used," but he wisely waited until the public sentiment
should consolidate, and all other means of maintaining the
integrity of the nation should have been exhausted. During
this session the way was prepared for the great edict of
Emancipation; Slavery was abolished at the National Capital,
prohibited forever in all the Territories, the slaves of rebels
declared free, and the Government authorized to employ
slaves as soldiers, and every person in the military or naval
service of the Republic prohibited from aiding in the arrest
of any fugitive slave. These measures were all urged by the
personal and political friends of the President, and became
laws with his sanction and hearty assent. They prepared the
way for the final overthrow of slavery.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.</h2>

<p>In April, 1862, it was known at Washington that the
President was considering the subject of emancipating the
slaves as a war measure. The Border States selected their
ablest man, the venerable John J. Crittenden, from Mr. Lincoln's
native State, to make a public appeal to him to stay
his hand. The eloquent Kentuckian discharged the part assigned
him well. Never shall I forget the scene when, with
great emotion before Congress he said, that although he had
voted against and opposed Mr. Lincoln, he had been won to
his side. "<i>And now</i>," said he, "there is a niche near to Washington
which should be occupied by him who shall save his
country. Mr. Lincoln has a mighty destiny! * * * He
is no coward, he may be President <i>of all the people</i> and fill
that niche, but if he chooses to be in these times a mere sectarian
and party man, that place will be reserved for some
future and better patriot." "It is in his power to occupy a
place next to Washington, the <i>founder</i> and <i>preserver</i> side by
side." It was understood the Border State men everywhere
were ready to crown him the peer of Washington if he would
not touch slavery.</p>

<p>It was <span class="smcap">Owen Lovejoy</span>, the early abolitionist, who
made an instantaneous, impromptu reply, a reply the eloquence
of which thrilled Congress and the country, and is
in my judgment among the finest specimens of American
eloquence.</p>

<p>Said he, "Let Abraham Lincoln make himself, as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
trust he will, the Emancipator, the liberator of a race, and
his name shall not only be enrolled in this earthly temple,
but it will be traced on the living stones of that Temple,
which rears itself amidst the thrones of Heaven." Alluding
to what Crittenden had said, he added, "There is
a niche for Abraham Lincoln in Freedom's holy fane. In
that niche he shall stand proudly, gloriously, with shattered
fetters, and broken chains and slave-whips beneath
his feet. * * This is a fame worth living for; ay, more,
it is a fame worth <i>dying</i> for, even though (said he with
prophetic prescience) that death led through the blood of
Gethsemane and the agony of the accursed tree."</p>

<p>These two speeches were read to Mr. Lincoln in his
library at the White House, a room to which he sometimes
retired. He was moved by the picture which Lovejoy
drew. The tremendous responsibilities growing out of
the slavery question, how he ought to treat those sons
of "unrequited toil," were questions sinking deeper and
deeper into his heart. With a purpose firmly to follow
the path of duty, as God should give him to see his duty,
he earnestly sought the divine guidance.</p>

<p>Speaking afterward of Emancipation, Mr. Lincoln said:
"When, in March, May, and July, 1862, I made earnest
and successive appeals to the Border States to favor compensated
emancipation, I believed the indispensable necessity
for military emancipation and arming the blacks
would come, unless averted by that measure. They declined
the proposition and I was in my best judgment
driven to the alternative of either surrendering the Union
or issuing the Emancipation Proclamation."<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> See Letter of the President to A. G. Hodges, dated April 4, 1864.</p></div>

<p>Before issuing the proclamation, he had appealed to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Border States to adopt gradual emancipation. His appeal is
one of the most earnest and eloquent papers in all history.
"Our country," said he, "is in great peril, demanding the
loftiest views and boldest action to bring a speedy relief;
once relieved, its form of government is saved to the world,
its beloved history and cherished memories are vindicated,
and its future fully assured and rendered inconceivably
grand."</p>

<p>The appeal was received by some with apathy, by others
with caviling and opposition, and was followed by action on
the part of none. Meanwhile his friends urged emancipation.
They declared there could be no permanent peace
while slavery lived. "Seize," cried they, "the thunderbolt of
Liberty, and shatter Slavery to atoms, and then the Republic
will live." After the great battle of Antietam, the President
called his cabinet together, and announced to them that
"<i>in obedience to a solemn vow to God</i>," he was about to issue
the edict of Freedom.</p>

<p>The proclamation came, modestly, sublimely, reverently the
great act was done. "Sincerely believing it to be an act of
justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity,
he invoked upon it the considerate judgment of mankind
and the gracious favor of Almighty God."</p>

<p>On the first of January, 1863, the Executive mansion, as is
usual on New Year's Day, was crowded with the officials,
foreign and domestic, of the National Capital; the men of
mark of the army and navy and from civil life crowded
around the care-worn President, to express their kind wishes
for him personally, and their prayers for the future of the
country.</p>

<p>During the reception, after he had been shaking hands
with hundreds, a secretary hastily entered and told him the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Proclamation (the final proclamation) was ready for his signature.
Leaving the crowd, he went to his office, taking up a
pen, attempting to write, and was astonished to find he could
not control the muscles of his hand and arm sufficiently to
write his name. He said to me, "I paused, and a feeling of
superstition, a sense of the vast responsibility of the act,
came over me; then, remembering that my arm had been well-nigh
paralyzed by two hours' of hand-shaking, I smiled at my
superstitious feeling, and wrote my name."</p>

<p>This Proclamation, the Declaration of Independence, and
<i>Magna Charta</i>, these be great landmarks, each indicating an
advance to a higher and more Christian civilization. Upon
these will the historian linger, as the stepping-stones toward
a higher plane of existence. From this time the war meant
<i>universal liberty</i>. When, in June, 1858, at his home in
Springfield, Lincoln startled the country by the announcement,
"this nation can not endure half <i>slave</i>, and <i>half free</i>," and
when he concluded that remarkable speech by declaring, with
uplifted eye and the inspired voice of a prophet, "we shall
not fail if we stand firm, <i>we shall not fail</i>, wise councils may
accelerate or mistakes delay, but sooner or later the victory is
sure to come," he looked to years of peaceful controversy and
final triumph through the ballot-box. He anticipated no
war, and he did not foresee, unless in those mysterious, dim
shadows, which sometimes startle by half revealing the
future, his own elevation to the presidency; he little dreamed
that he was to be the instrument in the hands of God to
speak those words which should emancipate a race and free
his country!</p>

<p>I have not space to follow the movements of the armies;
the long, sad campaigns of the grand army of the Potomac
under McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, Meade; nor the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
varying fortunes of war in the great Valley of the Mississippi
under Freemont, and Halleck, and Buell. Armies had not
only to be organized, but educated and trained, and especially
did the President have to search for and find those fitted for
high command.</p>

<p>Ultimately he found such and placed them at the head of
the armies. Up to 1863, there had been vast expenditures
of blood and treasure, and, although great successes had been
achieved and progress made, yet there had been so many disasters
and grievous failures, that the hopes of the insurgents
of final success were still confident. With all the great victories
in the South, and Southwest, by land and on the sea,
the Mississippi was still closed. The President opened the
campaign of 1863 with the determination of accomplishing
two great objects, first to get control of and open the Mississippi;
second to destroy the army of Virginia under Lee, and
seize upon the rebel capital. By the capture of Vicksburg,
and the fall of Port Hudson, the first and primary object of
the campaign was realized.</p>

<p>"The 'Father of Waters' again went unvexed to the sea.
Thanks to the great Northwest for it, nor yet wholly to them.
Three hundred miles up they met New England, Empire,
Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their way right and left. The
army South, too, in more colors than one, lent a helping
hand."<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> While the gallant armies of the West were achieving
these victories, operations in the East were crowned by the
decisively important triumph at Gettysburg. Let us pass over
the scenes of conflict, on the sea and on the land, at the East
and at the West, and come to that touching incident in the
life of Lincoln, the consecration of the battle-field of Gettysburg
as a National cemetery.</p>

<h2>GETTYSBURG.</h2>

<p>Here, late in the autumn of that year of battles, a portion
of that battle-ground was to be consecrated as the last resting-place
of those who there gave their lives that the Republic
might live.</p>

<p>There were gathered there the President, his Cabinet,
members of Congress, Governors of States, and a vast and
brilliant assemblage of officers, soldiers, and citizens, with
solemn and impressive ceremonies to consecrate the earth to
its pious purpose. New England's most distinguished orator
and scholar was selected to pronounce the oration. The
address of Everett was worthy of the occasion. When the
elaborate oration was finished, the tall, homely form of Lincoln
arose; simple, rude, majestic, slowly he stepped to the
front of the stage, drew from his pocket a manuscript, and
commenced reading that wonderful address, which an English
scholar and statesman has pronounced the finest in the English
language. The polished periods of Everett had fallen
somewhat coldly upon the ear, but Lincoln had not finished the
first sentence before the magnetic influence of a grand idea
eloquently uttered by a sympathetic nature, pervaded the vast
assemblage. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated
to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>

<p>"Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can
long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final
resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that
we should do this.</p>

<p>"But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate&mdash;we can not
consecrate&mdash;we can not hallow this ground. The brave men,
living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far
above our poor power to add or detract. The world will
little note, nor long remember what we <i>say</i> here, but it can
never forget what they <i>did</i> here. It is for us, the living,
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which
they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.</p>

<p>"It is, rather, for us to be here dedicated to the great task
remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last
full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain: that this nation,
under God, shall have a new birth of freedom: and that
government of the people, by the people, and for the people,
shall not perish from the earth."</p>

<p>He was so absorbed with the heroic sacrifices of the
soldiers as to be utterly unconscious that he was <i>the great
actor</i> in the drama, and that his simple words would live as
long as the memory of the heroism he there commemorated.</p>

<p>Closing his brief address amidst the deepest emotions of
the crowd, he turned to Everett and congratulated him upon
his success. "Ah, Mr. Lincoln," said the orator, "I would
gladly exchange my hundred pages for your twenty lines."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2>1864.</h2>

<p>On the first of January, 1864, Mr. Lincoln received his
friends as was usual on New Year's day, and the improved
prospects of the country, made it a day of congratulation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
The decisive victories East and West enlivened and made
buoyant and hopeful the spirits of all. One of the most
devoted friends of Mr. Lincoln calling upon him, after exchanging
congratulations over the progress of the Union
armies during the past year, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. President, one year from to-day, I may have
the pleasure of congratulating you on the consummation of
three events which seem now very probable."</p>

<p>"What are they?" said Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>"First, That the rebellion may be completely crushed.
Second, That slavery may be entirely destroyed, and prohibited
forever throughout the Union. Third, That Abraham
Lincoln may have been triumphantly re-elected President of
the United States."</p>

<p>"I would be very glad," said Mr. Lincoln, with a twinkle
in his eye, "to compromise, by securing the success of the
first two propositions."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2>LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT.</h2>

<p>On the 22d of February, 1864, President Lincoln nominated
General U. S. Grant as Lieutenant-General of all the
armies of the United States, and on the 9th of March, at
the White House, he, in person, presented the victorious
General with his commission, and sent him forth to consummate
with the armies of the East, his world-renowned
successes at the West. Then followed the memorable campaign
of 1864-5. Sherman's brilliant Atlanta campaign;
Sheridan's glorious career in the Valley of the Shenandoah;
Thomas's victories in Tennessee, the triumph at Lookout
Mountain; Sherman's "Grand march to the sea," the fall of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Mobile, the capture of Fort Fisher, and Wilmington, indicating
the near approach of peace through war. In the midst
of these successes, Mr. Lincoln was triumphantly re-elected,
the people thereby stamping upon his administration their
grateful approval. At the session of Congress, of 1864-5, he
urged the adoption of an amendment of the Constitution
abolishing and prohibiting slavery forever throughout the
Republic, thereby consummating his own great work of
Emancipation.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ABOLISHING SLAVERY.</h2>

<p>As the great leader in the overthrow of slavery, he had
seen his action sanctioned by an emphatic majority of the
people, and now the constitutional majority of two-thirds of
both branches of Congress had voted to submit to the States
this amendment of the organic law.</p>

<p>Illinois, the home of Lincoln, as was fit, took the lead in
ratifying this amendment, and other States rapidly followed,
until more than the requisite number was obtained, and the
amendment adopted. Meanwhile, military successes continued,
until the victory over slavery and rebellion was won.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2>LINCOLN'S SECOND INAUGURATION.</h2>

<p>It was known, by a dispatch received at the Capitol at
midnight, on the 3d of March, 1865, that Lee had sought an
interview with Grant, to arrange terms of surrender. On the
next day Lincoln again stood on the eastern colonnade of the
Capitol, again to swear fidelity to the Republic, her Constitution,
and laws; but, how changed the scene from his first inauguration.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
No traitors now occupied high places under the
Government. Crowds of citizens and soldiers who would
have died for their beloved Chief Magistrate now thronged
the area. Liberty loyalty, and victory had crowned the
eagles of our armies. No conspirators were now mingling in the
crowd, unless perchance the assassin Booth might have been
lurking there. Many patriots and statesmen were in their
graves. Douglas was dead, and Ellsworth, and Baker, and
McPherson, and Reynolds, and Wadsworth, and a host of martyrs,
had given their lives that liberty and the Republic might
triumph. It was a very touching spectacle to see the long
lines of invalid and wounded soldiers, from the great hospitals
about Washington, some on crutches, some who had lost an
arm, many pale from unhealed wounds, who gathered to witness
the scene. As Lincoln ascended the platform, and his
tall form, towering above all his associates, was recognized,
cheers and shouts of welcome filled the air, and not until he
raised his arm motioning for silence, could the acclamations
be hushed. He paused a moment, looked over the scene, and
still hesitated. What thronging memories passed through his
mind! Here, four years before, he had stood pleading, oh,
how earnestly, for <i>peace</i>. But, even while he pleaded, the
rebels took up the sword, and he was forced to "<i>accept war</i>."</p>

<p>Now four long, bloody, weary years of devastating war
had passed, and those who made the war were everywhere
discomfited, and being overthrown. That barbarous institution
which had caused the war, had been destroyed, and the
dawn of peace already brightened the sky. Such the scene,
and such the circumstances under which Lincoln pronounced
his second Inaugural, a speech which has no parallel since
Christ's Sermon on the Mount.</p>

<p>Who shall say that I am irreverent when I declare, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the passage, "Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray that
this <i>mighty scourge</i> of war <i>may speedily pass away</i>! yet, if
God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the
bondsmen's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil
shall be sunk, and every drop of blood drawn by the lash,
shall be paid by another drawn by the sword, as was said
three thousand years ago, so it must be said now, that
the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether,"
could only have been inspired by that <i>Holy Book</i>,
which daily he read, and from which he ever sought
guidance?</p>

<p>Where, but from the teachings of Christ, could he have
learned that charity in which he so unconsciously described
his own moral nature, "<i>With malice toward none, with charity
for all</i>, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the
right, let us finish the work we are in, <i>to bind up the nation's
wounds</i>, to care for him who hath borne the battle, and for
his widow and his orphans, to do all which may achieve a
just and lasting peace, among ourselves and among all
nations."</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2>END OF THE WAR.</h2>

<p>And now Mr. Lincoln gave his whole attention to
the movements of the armies, which, as he confidently
hoped, were on the eve of final and complete triumph.
On the 27th of March he visited the head-quarters of
General Grant, at City Point, to concert with his most
trusted military chiefs the final movements against
Lee, and Johnston. Grant was still at bay before
Petersburg. Sherman with his veterans, after occupying
Georgia and South Carolina, had reached Goldsboro',
North Carolina, on his victorious march north. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the hope and purpose of the two great leaders, whose
generous friendship for each other made them ever like
brothers, now and there to crush the armies of Lee and
Johnston, and finish the "job."</p>

<p>An artist has worthily painted the scene of the
meeting of Lincoln and his cabinet, when he first
announced and read to them his proclamation of Emancipation.
Another artist is now recording for the American
people the scene of this memorable meeting of the
President and the Generals, which took place in the
cabin of the steamer "River Queen," lying at the dock
in the James River. Three men more unlike personally
and mentally, and yet of more distinguished ability, have
rarely been called together. Although so entirely unlike,
each was a type of American character, and all had
peculiarities not only American, but Western.</p>

<p>Lincoln's towering form had acquired dignity by his
great deeds, and the great ideas to which he had given
expression. His rugged features, lately so deeply furrowed
with care and responsibility, were now radiant with
hope and confidence. He met the two great leaders with
grateful cordiality; with clear intelligence he grasped the
military situation, and listened with eager confidence to
their details of the final moves which should close this
terrible game of war.</p>

<p>Contrasting, with the giant-like stature of Lincoln, was
the short, sturdy, resolute form of the hero of Fort Donelson
and Vicksburg, so firm and iron-like, every feature of
his face and every attitude and movement so quiet, yet
all expressive of inflexible will and never faltering determination,
"to fight it out on this line."</p>

<p>There, too, was Sherman, with his broad intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
forehead, his restless eye, his nervous energy, his sharply
outlined features bronzed by that magnificent campaign
from Chattanooga to Atlanta and from Atlanta to the Sea,
and now fresh from the conquest of Georgia and South
Carolina. On the eve of final triumph, Lincoln, with
characteristic humanity deplored the necessity which all
realized, of one more hard and deadly battle. They
separated, Sherman hastening to his post, and Grant commenced
those brilliant movements which in ten days ended
the war. Now followed in rapid succession the fall of
Richmond, the surrender of Lee, the capitulation of Johnston
and his army, the capture of Jefferson Davis, and
the final overthrow of the rebellion.</p>

<p>The Union troops, on the morning of the 4th of April,
entered the rebel capital. Among the exulting columns which
followed the eagles of the Republic, were some regiments of
negro soldiers, who marched through the streets of Richmond
singing their favorite song of "John Brown's soul is marching
on."</p>

<p>On the day of its capture, President Lincoln, with Admiral
Porter, visited Richmond. Leading his youngest son, a lad,
by the hand, he walked from the James River landing to the
house just vacated by the rebel President. From the time
of the issuing of his proclamation to this, his triumphant
entry into the rebel capital, he had been ever ready and
anxious for peace. To all the world he had proclaimed, what
he said so emphatically to the rebel emissaries at Hampton
Roads. "There are just two indispensable conditions of
peace, national unity, and national liberty." "The national
authority must be restored through all the States, and I will
<i>never recede</i> from my position on the slavery question." He
would never violate the national faith, and now God had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
crowned his efforts with complete success. He entered
Richmond as a conqueror, but as its preserver he issued no
decree of proscription or confiscation, and to all the South
his policy was, "with malice toward none, with charity for
all, with firmness in the right as God gave him to see the
right, he sought to finish the work, and do all which should
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace."</p>

<p>On the 9th of April he returned to Washington, and had
scarcely arrived at the White House before the news of the
surrender of Lee and all his army reached him. No language
can adequately describe the joy and gratitude which filled the
hearts of the President and the people.</p>

<p>And here, before the attempt is made to sketch the darkest
and most dastardly crime in all our annals, let us pause
for one moment to mention that last review on the 22d and
23d of May, of these victorious citizen soldiers, who had come
at the call of the President, and who, their work being done,
were now to return again to their homes scattered throughout
the country they had saved.</p>

<p>These bronzed and scarred veterans who had survived the
battle-fields of four years of active war, whose field of operations
had been a continent, the brave men who had marched and
fought their way from New England and the Northwest, to
New Orleans and Charleston; those who had withstood and repelled
the terrific charges of the rebels at Gettysburg; those
who had fought beneath and above the clouds at Lookout
Mountain; who had taken Fort Donelson, Vicksburg, Atlanta,
New Orleans, Savannah, Mobile, Petersburg, and Richmond;
the triumphal entry of these heroes into the National Capital
of the Republic which they had saved and redeemed, was
deeply impressive. Triumphal arches, garlands, wreaths of
flowers, evergreens, marked their pathway. Acting President<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and Cabinet, Governors and Senators, ladies, children, citizens,
all united to express the nation's gratitude to those by whose
heroism it had been saved.</p>

<p>But there was one great shadow over the otherwise brilliant
spectacle. Lincoln, their great-hearted chief, he whom
all loved fondly to call their "Father Abraham;" he whose
heart had been ever with them in camp, and on the march, in
the storm of battle, and in the hospital; he had been murdered,
stung to death, by the fang of the expiring serpent
which these soldiers had crushed. There were many thousands
of these gallant men in Blue, as they filed past the
White House, whose weather-beaten faces were wet with
tears of manly grief. How gladly, joyfully would they have
given their lives to have saved his.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2>LAST DAYS OF LINCOLN.</h2>

<p>It has been already stated that Mr. Lincoln returned to
the Capital on the 9th of April; from that day until the 14th
was a scene of continued rejoicing, gratulation, and thanksgiving
to Almighty God who had given to us the victory.
In every city, town, village, and school district, bells rang,
salutes were fired, and the Union flag, now worshiped more
than ever by every loyal heart, waved from every home. The
President was full of hope and happiness. The clouds were
breaking away, and his genial, kindly nature was revolving
plans of reconciliation and peace. How could he now bind
up the wounds of his country and obliterate the scars of the
war, and restore friendship and good feeling to every section?
These considerations occupied his thoughts: there was no bitterness,
no desire for revenge. On the morning of the 14th,
Robert Lincoln, just returned from the army, where, on the
staff of General Grant, he had witnessed the surrender of Lee,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
breakfasted with his father, and the happy hour was passed
in listening to details of that event. The day was occupied,
first, with an interview with Speaker Colfax, then exchanging
congratulations with a party of old Illinois friends, then a cabinet
meeting, attended by Gen. Grant, at which all remarked
his hopeful, joyous spirit, and all bear testimony that in this
hour of triumph, he had no thought of vengeance, but his
mind was revolving the best means of bringing back to sincere
loyalty, those who had been making war upon his country.
He then drove out with Mrs. Lincoln alone, and during
the drive he dwelt upon the happy prospect now before
them, and contrasting the gloomy and distracting days of the
war with the peaceful ones now in anticipation, and looking
beyond the term of his Presidency, he, in imagination, saw
the time when he should return again to his prairie home,
meet his old friends, and resume his old mode of life. In fancy,
he was again in his old law library, and before the courts:
with these were mingled visions of a prairie farm, and once
more the plow and the ax should become familiar to his
hand. Such were some of the incidents and fancies of the
last day of the life of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2>THE ASSASSINATION.</h2>

<p>From the time of the election of Mr. Lincoln to the
Presidency, many threats, public and private, were made
of his assassination. An attempt to murder him would
undoubtedly have been made, in February, 1861, on his
passage through Baltimore, had not the plot been
discovered, and the time of his passage been anticipated.
From the day of his inauguration, he began to receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
letters threatening assassination. He said: "The first one
or two made me uncomfortable, but," said he, smiling,
"there is nothing like getting <i>used</i> to things." He was
constitutionally fearless, and came to consider these letters
as idle threats, meant only to annoy him, and it was
very difficult for his friends to induce him to resort to
any precautions.</p>

<p>It was announced through the press that on the
evening of the 14th of April, Mr. Lincoln and General
Grant would attend Ford's Theater. The General did
not attend, but Mr. Lincoln, being unwilling to disappoint
the public expectation, accompanied by Mrs. Lincoln, Miss
Harris, and Major Rathbone, was induced to go. The
writer met him on the portico of the White House
just as he was about to enter his carriage, exchanged
greetings with him, and will never forget the radiant,
happy expression of his countenance, and the kind, genial
tones of his voice, as we parted <i>for the night</i> as we
then thought&mdash;<i>forever</i> in this world, as it resulted.</p>

<p>The President was received, as he always was, by
acclamations. When he reached the door of his box,
he turned, and smiled, and bowed in acknowledgment
of the hearty greeting which welcomed him, and then
followed Mrs. Lincoln into the box. This was at the
right hand of the stage. In the corner nearest the stage
sat Miss Harris, next her Mrs. Lincoln. Mr. Lincoln
sat nearest the entrance, Major Rathbone being seated on
a sofa, in the back part of the box. The theater, and
especially the box occupied by the President's party, was
most beautifully draped with the national colors. While
the play was in progress, John Wilkes Booth visited the
theater behind the scenes, left a horse ready saddled in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
alley behind the building, leaving a door opening to this alley
ready for his escape.</p>

<p>In the midst of the play, at the hour of 10.30, a pistol
shot, sharp and clear, is heard! a man with a bloody dagger
in his hand leaps from the President's box to the stage
exclaiming, "<i>Sic semper tyrannis</i>," "the South is avenged."
As the assassin struck the stage, the spur on his boot having
caught in the folds of the flag, he fell to his knee. Instantly
rising, he brandished his dagger, darted across the stage, out
of the door he had left open, mounted his horse and galloped
away. The audience, startled and stupefied with horror, were
for a few seconds spell-bound. Some one cries out in the
crowd, "<i>John Wilkes Booth!</i>" This man, an actor, familiar
with the locality, after arranging for his escape, had passed
round to the front of the theater, entered, passed in to the
President's box, entered at the open and unguarded door, and
stealing up behind the President, who was intent upon the
play, placed his pistol near the back of the head of Mr. Lincoln,
and fired. The ball penetrated the brain, and the President
fell upon his face mortally wounded, unconscious and speechless
from the first. Major Rathbone had attempted to seize Booth
as he rushed past toward the stage, and received from the
assassin a severe cut in the arm.</p>

<p>No words can describe the anguish and horror of Mrs.
Lincoln. The scene was heart-rending; she prayed for death
to relieve her suffering. The insensible form of the President
was removed across the street to the house of a Mr. Peterson.
Robert Lincoln soon reached the scene, and the members of
the cabinet and personal friends crowded around the place of
the fearful tragedy. And there the strong constitution of Mr.
Lincoln struggled with death, until twenty-two minutes past
seven the next morning, when his heart ceased to beat. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
scene during that long fearful night of woe, at the house of
Peterson, beggars description.</p>

<p>News of the appalling deed spread through the city, and it
was found necessary to restrain the anxious, weeping people
by a double guard around the house. The surgeons from the
first examination of the wound, pronounced it mortal; and
the shock and the agony of that terrible night to Mrs. Lincoln
was enough to distract the reason, and break the heart of the
most self-controlled. Robert Lincoln sought, by manly self-mastery
to control his own grief and soothe his mother,
and aid her to sustain her overwhelming sorrow.</p>

<p>When at last, the noble heart ceased to beat, the Rev. Dr.
Gurley, in the presence of the family, the household, and
those friends of the President who were present, knelt down,
and touchingly prayed the Almighty Father, to aid and
strengthen the family and friends to bear their terrible
sorrow.</p>

<p>I will not attempt with feeble pen to sketch the
scenes of that terrible night; I leave that for the pencil of the
artist!</p>

<p>As has been said, the name of the assassin was John
Wilkes Booth! He was shot by Boston Corbett, a soldier on
the 21st of April.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2>ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF SECRETARY SEWARD.</h2>

<p>On the same night of the assassination of the President,
an accomplice of Booth attempted to murder Mr. Seward, the
Secretary of State, in his own house, while confined to his
bed from severe injuries received by being thrown from his
carriage. He was terribly mangled; and his life was saved
by the heroic efforts of his sons and daughter and a nurse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
whose name was Robinson. Some of the accomplices of
Booth were arrested, tried, convicted, and hung; but all were
the mere tools and instruments of the Conspirators. Mystery
and darkness yet hang over the chief instigators of this
most cowardly murder: none can say whether the chief conspirators
will ever, in this world, be dragged to light and
punishment.</p>

<p>The terrible news of the death of Lincoln was, on the
morning of the 15th, borne by telegraph to every portion of
the Republic. Coming, as it did, in the midst of universal
joy, no language can picture the horror and grief of the
people on its reception. A whole nation wept. Persons who
had not heard the news, coming into crowded cities, were
struck with the strange aspect of the people. All business
was suspended; gloom, sadness, grief, sat upon every face.
The flag, which had everywhere, from every spire and masthead,
roof, and tree, and public building, been floating in glorious
triumph, was now lowered; and, as the hours of that dreary
15th of April passed on, the people, by common impulse, each
family by itself, commenced draping their houses and public
buildings in mourning, and before night the whole nation was
shrouded in black.</p>

<p>There were no classes of people in the Republic whose
grief was more demonstrative than that of the soldiers and
the freedmen. The vast armies, not yet disbanded, looked
upon Lincoln as their father. They knew his heart had followed
them in all their campaigns and marches and battles.
Grief and vengeance filled their hearts. But the poor negroes
everywhere wept and sobbed over a loss which they instinctively
felt was to them irreparable. On the Sunday following
his death, the whole people gathered to their places of public
worship, and mingled their tears together over a bereavement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
which every one felt like the loss of a father or a brother.
The remains of the President were taken to the White
House. On the 17th, on Monday, a meeting of the members
of Congress then in Washington, was held at the Capitol, to
make arrangements for the funeral. This meeting named a
committee of one member from each State and Territory, and
the whole Congressional delegation from Illinois, as a Congressional
Committee to attend the remains of Mr. Lincoln to
their final resting-place in Illinois. Senator Sumner and
others desired that his body should be placed under the dome
of the Capitol at Washington. It was stated that a vault
had been prepared there for the remains of Washington, but
had never been used, because the Washington family and
Virginia desired them to remain in the family vault at Mount
Vernon. It was said it would be peculiarly appropriate for
the remains of Lincoln to be deposited under the dome of the
Capitol of the Republic he had saved and redeemed.</p>

<p>The funeral took place on Wednesday, the 19th. The
services were held in the East Room of the Executive Mansion.
It was a bright, genial day&mdash;typical of the kind and genial
nature of him whom a nation was so deeply mourning.</p>

<p>After the sad ceremonies at the National Capital, the
remains of the President and of his beloved son Willie, who
died at the White House during his presidency, were placed
on a funeral car, and started on its long pilgrimage to his old
home in Illinois, and it was arranged that the train should
take nearly the same route as that by which he had come from
Springfield to Washington in assuming the Executive Chair.</p>

<p>And now the people of every State, city, town, and hamlet,
came with uncovered heads, with streaming eyes, with
their offerings of wreaths and flowers, to witness the passing
train. It is impossible to describe the scenes. Minute-guns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the tolling of bells, music, requiems, dirges, military and civic
displays, draped flags, black covering every public building
and private house, everywhere indicated the pious desire of
the people to do honor to the dead: two thousand miles,
along which every house was draped in black, and from
which, everywhere, hung the national colors in mourning.
The funeral ceremonies at Baltimore were peculiarly impressive:
nowhere were the manifestations of grief more universal;
but the sorrow of the negroes, who thronged the
streets in thousands, and hung like a dark fringe upon the
long procession, was especially impressive. Their coarse,
homely features were convulsed with a grief which they
could not control; their emotional natures, excited by the
scene, and by each other, until sobs and cries and tears, rolling
down their black faces, told how deeply they felt their loss.
When the remains reached Philadelphia, a half million of
people were in the streets, to do honor to all that was left of
him, who, in old Independence Hall, four years before, had declared
that he would sooner die, sooner be assassinated, than
give up the principles of the Declaration of Independence.
He <i>had</i> been assassinated because he would <i>not</i> give them up.
All felt, when the remains were placed in that historic room,
surrounded by the memories of the great men of the Past,
whose portraits from the walls looked down upon the scene,
that a peer of the best and greatest of the revolutionary worthies
was now added to the list of those who had served the
Republic.</p>

<p>Through New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Indiana, to
Illinois, all the people followed the funeral train as mourners,
but when the remains reached his own State, where he had
been personally known to every one, where the people had all
heard him on the stump and in court, every family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
mourned him as a father and a brother. The train reached
Springfield on the 3d of May; and the corpse was taken to
Oak Ridge Cemetery, and there, among his old friends and
neighbors, his clients, and constituents, surrounded by
representatives from the Army and Navy, with delegations
from every State, with all the people, the world for his
mourners&mdash;was he buried.</p>

<h2>PERSONAL SKETCHES OF LINCOLN.<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></h2>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The substance of what follows is from chapter 29th of "The History of Abraham
Lincoln, and The Overthrow of Slavery," by Isaac N. Arnold.</p></div>

<p>In the remaining pages, I shall attempt to give a word-picture
of Mr. Lincoln, his person, his moral and intellectual
characteristics, and some personal recollections, so as to aid the
reader, as far as I may be able, in forming an ideal of the man.</p>

<p>Physically, he was a tall, spare man, six feet and four inches
in height. He stooped, leaning forward as he walked. He
was very athletic, with long, sinewy arms, large, bony hands,
and of great physical power. Many anecdotes of his
strength are given, which show that it was equal to that
of two or three ordinary men. He lifted with ease five or
six hundred pounds. His legs and arms were disproportionately
long, as compared with his body; and when he walked,
he swung his arms to and fro more than most men. When
seated, he did not seem much taller than ordinary men. In
his movements there was no grace, but an impression of
awkward strength and vigor.</p>

<p>He was naturally diffident, and even to the day of his
death, when in crowds, and not speaking or acting, and
conscious of being observed, he seemed to shrink with
bashfulness. When he became interested, or spoke, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>listened, this appearance left him, and he indicated no self-consciousness.
His forehead was high and broad, his hair very
dark, nearly black, and rather stiff and coarse, his eyebrows
were heavy, his eyes dark-gray, very expressive and varied;
now sparkling with humor and fun, and then deeply sad and
melancholy; flashing with indignation at injustice or wrong,
and then kind, genial, droll, dreamy; according to his mood.</p>

<p>His nose was large, and clearly defined and well shaped;
cheek-bones high and projecting. His mouth coarse, but
firm. He was easily caricatured&mdash;but difficult to represent as
he was, in marble or on canvass. The best bust of him is
that of Volk, which was modeled from a cast taken from life in
May, 1860, while he was attending court at Chicago.</p>

<p>Among the best portraits, in the judgment of his family
and intimate friends, are those of Carpenter, in the picture of
the Reading of the Proclamation of Emancipation before the
Cabinet, and that of Marshall.</p>

<p>He would be instantly recognized as belonging to that
type of tall, thin, large-boned men, produced in the northern
portion of the Valley of the Mississippi, and exhibiting its
peculiar characteristics in a most marked degree in Illinois,
Kentucky and Tennessee. In any crowd in the United States,
he would have been readily pointed out as a Western man.
His stature, figure, manner, voice, and accent, indicated that
he was of the Northwest. His manners were cordial, familiar,
genial; always perfectly self-possessed, he made every one feel
at home, and no one approached him without being impressed
with his kindly, frank nature, his clear, good sense, and his
transparent truthfulness and integrity. There is more or less
of expression and character in handwriting. Lincoln's was
plain, simple, clear, and legible, as that of Washington; but
unlike that of Washington, it was without ornament.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>In endeavoring to state those qualities which gave him
success and greatness, among the most important, it seems to
me, were a supreme love of truth, and a wonderful capacity
to ascertain it. Mentally, he had a perfect eye for truth.
His mental vision was clear and accurate: he saw things as
they were. I mean that every thing presented to his mind for
investigation, he saw divested of every extraneous circumstance,
every coloring, association, or accident which could mislead.
This gave him at the bar a sagacity which seemed
almost instinctive, in sifting the true from the false, and in
ascertaining facts; and so it was in all things through life.
He ever sought the real, the true, and the right. He was exact,
carefully accurate in all his statements. He analyzed well; he
saw and presented what lawyers call the very <i>gist</i> of every
question, divested of all unimportant or accidental relations,
so that his statement was a demonstration. At the bar, his
exposition of his case, or a question of law, was so clear, that,
on hearing it, most persons were surprised that there should
be any controversy about it. His reasoning powers were
keen and logical, and moved forward to a demonstration with
the precision of mathematics. What has been said implies
that he possessed not only a sound judgment, which brought
him to correct conclusions, but that he was able so to present
questions as to bring others to the same result.</p>

<p>His memory was capacious, ready, and tenacious. His
reading was limited in extent, but his memory was so ready,
and so retentive, that in history, poetry, and general literature,
no one ever remarked any deficiency. As an illustration
of the power of his memory, I recollect to have once called
at the White House, late in his Presidency, and introducing
to him a Swede and a Norwegian; he immediately repeated
a poem of eight or ten verses, describing Scandinavian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
scenery and old Norse legends. In reply to the expression of
their delight, he said that he had read and admired the poem
several years before, and it had entirely gone from him, but
seeing them recalled it.</p>

<p>The two books which he read most were the Bible and
Shakespeare. With these he was very familiar, reading and
studying them habitually and constantly. He had great
fondness for poetry, and eloquence, and his taste and judgment
in each was exquisite. Shakespeare was his favorite
poet; Burns stood next. I know of a speech of his at a
Burns festival, in which he spoke at length of Burns's poems;
illustrating what he said by many quotations, showing perfect
familiarity with and full appreciation of the peasant poet of
Scotland. He was extremely fond of ballads, and of simple,
sad, and plaintive music.</p>

<p>He was a most admirable reader. He read and repeated
passages from the Bible and Shakespeare with great simplicity
but remarkable expression and effect. Often when going to
and from the army, on steamers and in his carriage, he took a
copy of Shakespeare with him, and not unfrequently read,
aloud to his associates. After conversing upon public affairs,
he would take up his Shakespeare, and addressing his companions,
remark, "What do you say now to a scene from Macbeth,
or Hamlet, or Julius C&aelig;sar," and then he would read
aloud, scene after scene, never seeming to tire of the enjoyment.</p>

<p>On the last Sunday of his life, as he was coming up the
Potomac, from his visit to City Point and Richmond, he
read aloud many extracts from Shakespeare. Among others,
he read, with an accent and feeling which no one who heard
him will ever forget, extracts from Macbeth, and among others
the following:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <p class="i8">"Duncan is in his grave;</p>
  <p class="i2">After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well.</p>
  <p class="i2">Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,</p>
  <p class="i2">Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing</p>
  <p class="i2">Can touch him farther."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After "treason" had "<i>done his worst</i>," the friends who
heard him on that occasion remembered that he read that
passage very slowly over twice, and with an absorbed and
peculiar manner. Did he feel a mysterious presentiment of
his approaching fate?</p>

<p>His conversation was original, suggestive, instructive, and
playful; and, by its genial humor, fascinating and attractive
beyond comparison. Mirthfulness and sadness were strongly
combined in him. His mirth was exuberant, it sparkled in
jest, story, and anecdote; and the next moment those peculiarly
sad, pathetic, melancholy eyes, showed a man "familiar
with sorrow, and acquainted with grief." I have listened for
hours at his table, and elsewhere, when he has been surrounded
by statesmen, military leaders, and other distinguished men
of the nation, and I but repeat the universally concurring
verdict of all, in stating that as a conversationalist he had no
equal. One might meet in company with him the most distinguished
men, of various pursuits and professions, but after
listening for two or three hours, on separating, it was what
Lincoln had said that would be remembered. His were the
ideas and illustrations that would not be forgotten. Men
often called upon him for the pleasure of listening to him. I
have heard the reply to an invitation to attend the theater,
"No, I am going up to the White House. I would rather
hear Lincoln talk for half an hour, than attend the best
theater in the world."</p>

<p>As a public speaker, without any attempt at oratorical
display, I think he was the most effective of any man of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
day. When he spoke, everybody listened. It was always
obvious, before he completed two sentences, that he had
something to say, and it was sure to be something original,
something different from any thing heard from others, or
which had been read in books. He impressed the hearer at
once, as an earnest, sincere man, who believed what he said.
To-day, there are more of the sayings of Lincoln repeated by
the people, more quotations, sentences, and extracts from his
writings and speeches, familiar as "household words," than
from those of any other American.</p>

<p>I know no book, except the Bible and Shakespeare, from
which so many familiar phrases and expressions have been
taken as from his writings and speeches. Somebody has
said, "I care not who makes the laws, if I may write the
ballads of a nation." The words of Lincoln have done more
in the last six years to mold and fashion the American character
than those of any other man, and their influence has
been all for truth, right, justice, and liberty. Great as has
been Lincoln's services to the people, as their President, his
influence, derived from his words and his example, in molding
the future national character, in favor of justice, right,
liberty, truth, and real, sincere, unostentatious reverence for
God, is scarcely less important. The Republic of the future,
the matured national character, will be more influenced by
him than by any other man. This is evidence of his greatness,
intellectual, and still more, moral. In this power of
impressing himself upon the people, he contrasts with many
other distinguished men in our history. Few quotations
from Jefferson, or Adams, or Webster, live in the every-day
language of the people. Little of Clay survives; not much
of Calhoun, and who can quote, off-hand, half a dozen sentences
from Douglas? But you hear Lincoln's words, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
only in every cabin and caucus, and in every stump speech, but
at every school-house, high-school, and college declamation, and
by every farmer and artisan, as he tells you story after story
of Lincoln's, and all to the point, hitting the nail on the head
every time, and driving home the argument. Mr. Lincoln was
not a scholar, but where is there a speech more exhaustive in
argument than his Cooper Institute address? Where any thing
more full of pathos than his farewell to his neighbors at
Springfield, when he bade them good-bye, on starting for the
capital? Where any thing more eloquent than his appeal for
peace and union, in his first Inaugural, or than his defense of
the Declaration of Independence in the Douglas debates?
Where the equal of his speech at Gettysburg? Where a
more conclusive argument than in his letter to the Albany
Meeting on Arrests? What is better than his letter to the
Illinois State Convention; and that to Hodges of Kentucky,
in explanation of his anti-slavery policy? Where is there
any thing equal in simple grandeur of thought and sentiment,
to his last Inaugural? From all of these, and many others,
from his every-day talks, are extracts on the tongues of the
people, as familiar, and nearly as much reverenced, as texts
from the Bible; and these are shaping the national character.
"Though dead, he yet speaketh."</p>

<p>As a public speaker, if excellence is measured by results, he
had no superior. His manner was generally earnest, often playful;
sometimes, but this was rare, he was vehement and impassioned.
There have been a few instances, at the bar and on
the stump, when, wrought up to indignation by some great
personal wrong, or by an aggravated case of fraud or injustice,
or when speaking of the fearful wrongs and injustice of slavery,
he broke forth in a strain of impassioned vehemence which
carried every thing before him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Generally, he addressed the reason and judgment, and the
effect was lasting. He spoke extemporaneously, but not
without more or less preparation. He had the power of
repeating, without reading it, a discourse or speech which he
had prepared or written out. His great speech, in opening
the Douglas canvass, in June, 1858, was carefully written out,
but so naturally spoken that few suspected that it was not
extemporaneous. In his style, manner of presenting facts,
and way of putting things to the people, he was more like
Franklin than any other American. His illustrations, by
anecdote and story, were not unlike the author of <i>Poor
Richard</i>.</p>

<p>A great cause of his intellectual power was the thorough
exhaustive investigation he gave to every subject. Take, for
illustration, his Cooper Institute speech. Hundreds of able
and intelligent men have spoken on the same subject treated
by him in that speech, yet what they said will all be forgotten,
and his will survive; because his address is absolutely perfect
for the purpose for which it was designed. Nothing can
be added to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln, however, required time thoroughly to investigate
before he came to his conclusions, and the movements of
his mind were not rapid; but when he reached his conclusions
he believed in them, and adhered to them with great
firmness and tenacity. When called upon to decide quickly
upon a new subject or a new point, he often erred, and was
ever ready to change when satisfied he was wrong.</p>

<p>It was the union, in Mr. Lincoln, of the capacity clearly to
see the truth, and an innate love of truth, and justice, and
right in his heart, that constituted his character and made
him so great. He never demoralized his intellectual or moral
powers, either by doing wrong that good might come, or by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
advocating error because it was popular. Although, as a
statesman, eminently practical, and looking to the possible
good of to-day, he ever kept in mind the absolute truth and
absolute right, toward which he always aimed.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln was an unselfish man; he never sought his
own advancement at the expense of others. He was a just
man; he never tried to pull others down that he might rise.
He disarmed rivalry and envy by his rare generosity. He
possessed the rare wisdom of magnanimity. He was eminently
a tender-hearted, kind, and humane man. These traits
were illustrated all through his life. He loved to pardon:
he was averse to punish. It was difficult for him to deny
the request of a child, a woman, or of any who were weak
and suffering. Pages of incidents might be quoted, showing
his ever-thoughtful kindness, gratitude to, and appreciation of
the soldiers. The following note (written to a lady known to
him only by her sacrifices for her country) is selected from
many on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Executive Mansion, Washington</span>,<br />
"November, 1864.</p>

<p class="smcap">"Dear Madam:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been shown, in the files of the War Department, a statement of the
Adjutant-General of Massachusetts, that you are the mother of five sons who have
died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any
words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so
overwhelming. But I can not refrain from tendering to you the consolation that
may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our
Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you
only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must
be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="r5">"Yours very respectfully,</span><br />
"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>

<p>"To Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bixby</span>, Boston, Massachusetts."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One summer's day, in walking along the shaded path
which leads from the White House to the War Department,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
I saw the tall form of the President seated on the grass under
a tree, with a wounded soldier sitting by his side. He had a
bundle of papers in his hand. The soldier had met him in
the path, and, recognizing him, had asked his aid. Mr. Lincoln
sat down upon the grass, investigated the case, and sent the
soldier away rejoicing. In the midst of the rejoicings over the
triumphs at Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain, he forgets not
to telegraph to Grant, "Remember Burnside" at Knoxville.</p>

<p>His charity, in the best sense of that word, was pervading.
When others railed, he railed not again. No bitter words,
no denunciation can be found in his writings or speeches.
Literally, in his heart there was "malice toward none, and
charity for all."</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln was by nature a gentleman. No man can
point, in all his lifetime, to any thing mean, small, tricky, dishonest,
or false; on the contrary, he was ever open, manly,
brave, just, sincere, and true. That characteristic, attributed
to him by some, of coarse story-telling, did not exist. I assert
that my intercourse with him was constant for many years
before he went to Washington, and I saw him daily, during
the greater part of his Presidency; and although his stories
and anecdotes were racy, witty, and pointed beyond all comparison,
yet I never heard one of a character to need palliation
or excuse. If a story had wit and was apt, he did not reject
it, because to a vulgar or impure mind it suggested coarse
ideas; but he himself was unconscious of any thing but its
wit and aptness.</p>

<p>It may interest the people who did not visit Washington
during his Presidency, to know something of his habits, and
the room he occupied and transacted business in, during his
administration. His reception-room was on the second floor,
on the south side of the White House, and the second apartment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
from the southeast corner. The corner room was occupied
by Mr. Nicolay, his private secretary; next to this was
the President's reception-room. It was, perhaps, thirty by
twenty feet. In the middle of the west side, was a large
marble fireplace, with old-fashioned brass andirons, and a
large, high, brass fender. The windows looked to the south,
upon the lawn and shrubbery on the south front of the White
House, taking in the unfinished Washington Monument,
Alexandria, the Potomac, and down that beautiful river
toward Mount Vernon. Across the Potomac was Arlington
Heights. The view from these windows was altogether very
beautiful.</p>

<p>The furniture of this room consisted of a long oak table,
covered with cloth, and oak chairs. This table stood in the
center of the room, and was the one around which the Cabinet
sat, at Cabinet meetings, and is faithfully painted in Carpenter's
picture of the Emancipation Proclamation. At the end
of the table, near the window, was a large writing-table and
desk, with pigeon-holes for papers, such as are common in
lawyers' offices. In front of this, in a large arm-chair, Mr.
Lincoln usually sat. Behind his chair, and against the west
wall of the room, was another writing-desk high enough to
write upon when standing, and upon the top of this were a
few books, among which were the Statutes of the United
States, a Bible, and a copy of Shakespeare. There was a
bureau, with wooden doors, with pigeon-holes for papers,
standing between the windows. Here the President kept
such papers as he wished readily to refer to. There were
two plain sofas in the room; generally two or three map-frames,
from which hung military maps, on which the movements
of the armies were continually traced and followed.
The only picture in the room was an old engraving of Jackson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
which hung over the fireplace; late in his administration
was added a fine photograph of John Bright. Two doors
opened into this room&mdash;one from the Secretary's, the other
from the great hall, where the crowd usually waited. A bell-cord
hung within reach of his hand, while he sat at his desk.
There was an ante-room adjoining this, plainly furnished; but
the crowd usually pressed to the hall, from which an entrance
might be directly had to the President's room. A messenger
stood at the door, and took in the cards and names of visitors.</p>

<p>Here, in this room, more plainly furnished than many law
and business offices&mdash;plainer than the offices of the heads of
bureaus in the Executive Departments&mdash;Mr. Lincoln spent
the days of his Presidency. Here he received everybody,
from the Lieutenant-General and Chief-Justice, down to the
private soldier and humblest citizen. Custom had established
certain rules of precedence, fixing the order in which officials
should be received. The members of the Cabinet and the
high officers of the army were, of course, received always
promptly. Senators and members of Congress, who are
usually charged with the presentation of petitions and recommendations
for appointments, and who are expected to right
every wrong and correct every evil each one of their respective
constituents may be suffering, or imagine himself to
be suffering, have an immense amount of business with the
Executive. I have often seen as many as ten or fifteen Senators
and twenty or thirty Members of the House in the hall,
waiting their turn to see the President. They would go to
the ante-room, or up to the hall in front of the reception-room,
and await their turns. The order of precedence was,
first the Vice-President, if present, then the Speaker of the
House, and then Senators and Members of the House in the
order of their arrival, and the presentation of their cards. Frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Senators and Members would go to the White House
as early as eight or nine in the morning, to secure precedence
and an early interview. While they waited, the loud ringing
laugh of Mr. Lincoln, in which he was sure to be joined
by all <i>inside</i>, but which was rather provoking to those <i>outside</i>,
was often heard by the waiting and impatient crowd.
Here, from early morning to late at night, he sat, listened,
and decided&mdash;patient, just, considerate, hopeful. All the
people came to him as to a father. He was more accessible
than any of the leading members of his Cabinet&mdash;much more
so than Mr. Seward, shut up in the State Department, writing
his voluminous dispatches; far more so than Mr. Stanton, indefatigable,
stern, abrupt, but ever honest and faithful. Mr.
Lincoln saw everybody&mdash;governors, senators, congressmen,
officers, ministers, bankers, merchants, farmers&mdash;all classes of
people; all approached him with confidence, from the highest
to the lowest; but this incessant labor and fearful responsibility
told upon his vigorous frame. He left Illinois for the
capital, with a frame of iron and nerves of steel. His old
friends, who knew him in Illinois as a man who knew not
what illness was, who knew him ever genial and sparkling
with fun, as the months and years of the war passed slowly
on, saw the wrinkles on his forehead deepened into furrows;
and the laugh of old days became sometimes almost hollow;
it did not now always seem to come from the heart, as in
former years. Anxiety, responsibility, care, thought, wore
upon even his giant frame, and his nerves of steel became at
times irritable. For more than four years he had no respite,
no holidays. When others fled away from the dust and heat
of the capital, he must stay; he would not leave the helm
until the danger was past and the ship was in port.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lincoln watched his care-worn face with the anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of an affectionate wife, and sometimes took him from his
labors almost in spite of himself. She urged him to ride, and
to go to the theater and places of amusement, to divert his
mind from his engrossing cares.</p>

<p>Let us for a moment try to appreciate the greatness of his
work and his services. He was the Commander-in-Chief,
during the war, of the largest army and navy in the world;
and this army and navy was created during his administration,
and its officers were sought out and appointed by him.
The operations of the Treasury were vast beyond all previous
conceptions of the ability of the country to sustain; and yet,
when he entered upon the Presidency, he found an empty
treasury, the public credit shaken, no army, no navy, the
officers all strangers, many deserting, more in sympathy
with the rebels, Congress divided, and public sentiment unformed.
The party which elected him were in a minority.
The old Democratic party, which had ruled the country for
half a century, hostile to him, and, by long political association,
in sympathy with the insurgent States. His own party, new,
made up of discordant elements, and not yet consolidated,
unaccustomed to rule, and neither his party nor himself possessing
any <i>prestige</i>. He entered the White House, the object
of personal prejudice to a majority of the people, and of
contempt to a powerful minority. And yet I am satisfied,
from the statement of the conversation of Mr. Lincoln with
Mr. Bateman, quoted hereafter, and from various other reasons,
that he himself more fully appreciated the terrible conflict
before him than any man in the nation, and that even
then he hoped and expected to be the <i>Liberator</i> of the slaves.
He did not yet clearly perceive the manner in which it was
to be done, but he believed it would be done, and that God
would guide him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>In four years, this man crushed the most stupendous rebellion,
supported by armies more vast, and resources greater
than were ever before combined to overthrow any government.
He held together and consolidated, against warring
factions, his own great party, and strengthened it by securing
the confidence and bringing to his aid a large proportion of
all other parties. He was re-elected almost by acclamation,
and he led the people, step by step, up to emancipation, and
saw his work crowned by the Constitutional Amendment,
eradicating Slavery from the Republic for ever. Did this
man lack firmness? Study the boldness of the Emancipation!
See with what fidelity he stood by his Proclamation!
In his message of 1863, he said: "I will <i>never</i> retract
the proclamation, nor return to slavery any person made free
by it." In 1864, he said: "If it should ever be made a duty
of the Executive to return to slavery any person made free
by the Proclamation or the acts of Congress, some other person,
not I, must execute the law."</p>

<p>When hints of peace were suggested as obtainable by
giving over the negro race again to bondage, he repelled it
with indignation. When the rebel Vice-President, Stephens,
at Fortress Monroe, tempted him to give up the freedman,
and seek the glory of a foreign war, in which the Union and
Confederate soldiers might join, neither party sacrificing its
honor, he was inflexible; he would die sooner than break
the nation's plighted faith.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln did not enter with reluctance upon the plan
of emancipation; and in this statement I am corroborated by
Lovejoy and Sumner, and many others. If he did not act
more promptly, it was because he knew he must not go faster
than the people. Men have questioned the firmness, boldness,
and will of Mr. Lincoln. He had no vanity in the exhibition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of power, but he quietly acted, when he felt it his
duty so to do, with a boldness and firmness never surpassed.</p>

<p>What bolder act than the surrender of Mason and Slidell,
against the resolution of Congress and the almost universal
popular clamor, without consulting the Senate or taking
advice from his Cabinet? The removals of McClellan and
Butler, the modification of the orders of Fremont and Hunter,
were acts of a bold, decided character. He acted for himself,
taking personally the responsibility of deciding the great
questions of his administration.</p>

<p>He was the most democratic of all the presidents. Personally,
he was homely, plain, without pretension, and without
ostentation. He believed in the people, and had faith in
their good impulses. He ever addressed himself to their
reason, and not to their prejudices. His language was simple,
sometimes quaint, never sacrificing expression to elegance.
When he spoke to the people, it was as though he said to
them, "Come, let us reason together." There can not be found
in all his speeches or writings a single vulgar expression, nor
an appeal to any low sentiment or prejudice. He had nothing
of the demagogue. He never himself alluded to his humble
origin, except to express regret for the deficiencies of his education.
He always treated the people in such a way, that
they knew that he respected them, believed them honest,
capable of judging correctly, and disposed to do right.</p>

<p>I know not how, in a few words, I can better indicate his
political and moral character, than by the following incident:
A member of Congress, knowing the purity of his life, his
reverence for God, and his respect for religion, one day expressed
surprise, that he had not joined a church. After
mentioning some difficulties he felt in regard to some articles
of faith, Mr. Lincoln said, "<i>Whenever any church</i> will inscribe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
over its altar, as its sole qualification for membership, Christ's
condensed statement of both Law and Gospel, '<i>Thou shalt
love the Lord, thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself</i>,' that
church will I join with all my heart."</p>

<p>Love to God, as the great Father, love to man as his
brother, constituted the basis of his political and moral creed.</p>

<p>One day, when one of his friends was denouncing his political
enemies, "Hold on," said Mr. Lincoln, "Remember
what St. Paul says, 'and now abideth faith, hope, charity,
these three; <i>but the greatest of these is charity</i>.'"</p>

<p>From the day of his leaving Springfield to assume the
duties of the Presidency, when he so impressively asked his
friends and neighbors to invoke upon him the guidance and
wisdom of God, to the evening of his death, he seemed ever to
live and act in the consciousness of his responsibility to Him,
and with the trusting faith of a child he leaned confidingly
upon His Almighty Arm. He was visited during his administration
by many Christian delegations, representing the
various religious denominations of the Republic, and it is
known that he was relieved and comforted in his great work
by the consciousness that the Christian world were praying
for his success. Some one said to him, one day, "No man was
ever so remembered in the prayers of the people, especially of
those who pray not to be heard of men, as you are." He replied,
"I have been a good deal helped by just that thought."</p>

<p>The support which Mr. Lincoln received during his administration
from the religious organizations, and the sympathy
and confidence between the great body of Christians and the
President, was indeed a source of immense strength and power
to him.</p>

<p>I know of nothing revealing more of the true character of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Mr. Lincoln, his conscientiousness, his views of the slavery
question, his sagacity and his full appreciation of the awful
trial through which the country and he had to pass, than the
following incident stated by Mr. Bateman, Superintendent of
Public Instruction for Illinois.</p>

<p>On one occasion, in the autumn of 1860, after conversing
with Mr. Bateman at some length, on the, to him, strange conduct
of Christian men and ministers of the Gospel supporting
slavery, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know there is a God, and that He hates injustice and
slavery. I see the storm coming, and I know that His hand
is in it. If He has a place and work for me&mdash;and I think He
has&mdash;I believe I am ready. I am nothing, but truth is every
thing. I know I am right, because I know that Liberty is
right, for Christ teaches it, and Christ is God. I have told
them that a house divided against itself can not stand; and
Christ and Reason say the same; and they will find it so.</p>

<p>"Douglas don't care whether slavery is voted up or down,
but God cares, and humanity cares, and I care; and with
God's help I shall not fail. I may not see the end; but it will
come, and I shall be vindicated; and these men will find that
they have not read their Bibles right."</p>

<p>Much of this was uttered as if he were speaking to himself,
and with a sad, earnest solemnity of manner impossible
to be described. After a pause, he resumed: "Doesn't it
appear strange that men can ignore the moral aspect of this
contest? A revelation could not make it plainer to me that
slavery or the Government must be destroyed. The future
would be something awful, as I look at it, but for this rock on
which I stand (alluding to the Testament which he still held
in his hand). It seems as if God had borne with this thing
(slavery) until the very teachers of religion had come to defend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
it from the Bible, and to claim for it a divine character
and sanction; and now the cup of iniquity is full, and the
vials of wrath will be poured out." After this, says Mr. Bateman,
the conversation was continued for a long time. Every
thing he said was of a peculiarly deep, tender, and religious
tone, and all was tinged with a touching melancholy. He
repeatedly referred to his conviction that the day of wrath
was at hand, and that he was to be an actor in the terrible
struggle which would issue in the overthrow of slavery,
though he might not live to see the end.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The foregoing statement has been verified by Mr. Bateman as substantially
correct.</p></div>

<p>Perhaps in all history there is no example of such great
and long continued injustice as that of the British press
during the war toward Mr. Lincoln. His death shamed them
into decency. While he lived they sneered at his manners.
Let them turn to their own Cromwell. They said his person was
ugly. Has the world recognized the ability of Mirabeau, or
that of Henry Brougham, notwithstanding their ugliness?
They made scurrile jests about his figure, as though a statesman
must be necessarily a sculptor's model! They were
facetious about his dress, as though a greater than a Fox or a
Chatham must be a Beau Brummel. They were horrified
by his jokes. If the same had been told by the patrician
Palmerston, instead of the plebeian Lincoln, they would not
have lacked the "Attic salt," but would have rivaled Dean
Swift or Sidney Smith.</p>

<p>It has been truly said there is one parallel only, to English
journalism's treatment of Lincoln, and that is to be found in
their treatment of Napoleon. "The Corsican Ogre," and the
"American Ape," were phrases coined in the same mint. But
the great Corsican was England's bitter foe; Lincoln was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>never provoked either by his own or his country's wrongs, to
hostility against Great Britain. Yet at the great Martyr's
grave, even this injustice changed to respect and reverence;
even "Punch" repented and said&mdash;</p>

<div class="inset20">
<p>
"Yes he had lived to shame me from my sneer,<br />
To lame my pencil, and confute my pen;<br />
To make me own this hind, of princes <i>peer</i>,<br />
This rail-splitter a true-born <i>King</i> of men."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The place Mr. Lincoln will occupy in history, will be higher
than any which he held while living. His Emancipation
Proclamation is the most important historical event of the
nineteenth century. Its influence will not be limited by time,
nor bounded by locality. It will ever be treated by the historian
as one of the great landmarks of human progress.</p>

<p>He has been compared and contrasted with three great personages
in history, who were assassinated,&mdash;with C&aelig;sar, with
William of Orange, and with Henry IV. of France. He was
a nobler type of man than either, as he was the product of a
higher and more Christian civilization.</p>

<p>The two great men by whose words and example our great
continental Republic is to be fashioned and shaped are Washington
and Lincoln. Representative men of the East, and of
the West, of the Revolutionary era, and the era of Liberty
for all. One sleeps upon the banks of the Potomac, and the
other on the great prairies of the Valley of the Mississippi.
Lincoln was as pure as Washington, as modest, as just, as
patriotic; less passionate by nature, more of a democrat in his
feelings and manners, with more faith in the people, and more
hopeful of their future. Statesmen and patriots will study
their record and learn the wisdom of goodness.</p>

<p class="h5">GETTYSBURG.</p>

<p>When a person is desirous of procuring a published work upon
any subject, it is natural for him to inquire for the sources of
information from which the author has compiled that work. I have,
therefore, without wishing to be considered egotistical, concluded to
issue this prospectus to such as have an interest in the Battle of
Gettysburg, that they may know what I have already done, and what
I yet propose to do, to eliminate the history of that battle.</p>

<p class="h5">ISOMETRICAL DRAWING OF THE GETTYSBURG BATTLE-FIELD.</p>

<p>In compiling the Isometrical Drawing of the Gettysburg Battle-field, it was
first necessary to establish its extent and boundaries. When I arrived at Gettysburg
the <i>debris</i> of that great battle lay scattered for miles around. Fresh mounds
of earth marked the resting-place of the fallen thousands, and many of the dead
lay yet unburied. It therefore required no guide to point out the locality where
the battle had been fought.</p>

<p>As the term <i>field</i>, when applied to a battle, is generally used figuratively, and,
by the general reader, might be misunderstood, it is well to consider at the start,
that the battle-<i>field</i> of Gettysburg not only embraces within its boundaries many
<i>fields</i>, but forests as well, and even the town of Gettysburg itself is included in
that battle-field. The formation of the ground and the positions of the troops,
favored the plan of sketching the field while facing the west. Consequently the
top of my <span class="smcap">Drawing</span> of it is west: the right hand, north; the left, south, &amp;c.
There was no point from which the whole field could be sketched, nor would such
a position have favored this branch of Art. On the contrary, it was necessary to
sketch from <i>every</i> part of the field, combining the whole into one grand view.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/ill-ad-002.jpg" width="400" height="283" alt="DEATH OF GEN. ZOOK." />
</div>

<p class="caption">DEATH OF GEN. ZOOK.</p>

<p>Having located its boundaries, I commenced at the southeast corner, and
gradually moving toward the <i>north</i>, I looked toward the <i>west</i>, and sketched it
carefully, as far as the vision extended, including fields, forests, houses, barns,
hills, and valleys; and every object, however minute, which would influence the
result of a battle. Thus I continued to the northeast boundary, a distance of five
and a half miles. The next day I resumed my work at the south (having advanced
to the point where my vision had been obstructed the preceding day), and sketched
another breadth to the north, as before: and so continued, day by day, until I had
carried my Drawing forward four and a half miles, which included within its
limits the town of Gettysburg. When the Battle-field had been <i>Isometrically</i>
drawn. I sketched in the <i>distance</i> and added a sky.</p>

<p>This Drawing was the result of eighty-four days spent on that field immediately
after the battle, during which time I sketched accurately the twenty-five
square miles which it represents.</p>

<p>I spent two months in hospital writing down the statements of Confederate
prisoners, and as they became convalescent, I went over the field with many
of their officers, who located their positions and explained the movements of their
commands during the battle.</p>

<p>I then visited the <span class="smcap">Army of the Potomac</span>, consulted with its Commander-in-Chief,
Corps, Division, and Brigade commanders, and visited every Regiment and
Battery engaged, to whose officers the sketch of the field was submitted, and they,
after careful consultation, located upon it the positions of their respective commands.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">PHILLIPS&#39; 5th MASS. BATTERY</p>

<p>From the information thus obtained, I have traced the movements of <i>every
Regiment and Battery</i> from the commencement to the close of the battle, and
have located on the Drawing its most important position for each of the three
days.</p>

<p>Since its publication I issued an invitation to the officers of the Army of the
Potomac to visit Gettysburg with me, and point out their respective positions and
movements, thus giving an opportunity to the <i>actors</i> in this great drama to correct
any misapprehension, and establish, while still fresh in memory, the facts and
details of this most important battle of the age. This invitation was responded to
by over one thousand officers engaged in the battle; twenty-eight of whom were
Generals commanding. And it may be interesting to those who possess the Drawing,
to know that <i>but one solitary Regiment</i> was discovered to be out of position
on it.</p>

<p>Many thousand copies of this work have been sold, yet the demand still continues,
and orders are constantly coming in from all parts of the country. Though
complete in itself, it is really but the <i>introduction</i> to other works yet to be published
on this battle, and will be considered almost an indispensable companion to
the history of it.</p>

<p>The original plate has not been used except to print copies for <i>transfers</i>. The
<i>first</i> impressions from each transfer are reserved for <span class="smcap">PROOFS</span>. Therefore the
quality of the print can never materially change, as the original plate would furnish
a thousand transfers. The <i>colored</i> <span class="smcap">PROOFS</span> are carefully colored by an Artist.
The <span class="smcap">TINTED</span> and <span class="smcap">PLAIN</span> editions are next printed, and when the plate is worn a new
transfer is made.</p>

<p>To any person remitting the money, for either of the above styles, I will forward
the print by mail, to any part of the United States, <span class="smcap">Free of Charge</span>, carefully
packed on a roll: or, I will send it by express, at their expense, with bill for
collection. I have sent hundreds by mail, to all parts of the country, and have yet
to hear of the first copy being lost or injured, while it is quite a saving of expense.
A <i>Key</i>, embracing a brief description of the battle, accompanies each print without
extra charge. I have hundreds of letters of indorsement from which I select

<p>Since the publication of the Drawing, and even before, I have been steadily
engaged in compiling the History of the Battle of Gettysburg. I have traveled
many thousand miles to add to my knowledge. I have received a great number
of letters relating to it, and the Government have very considerately placed at my
disposal the entire Reports of both the Union and Confederate officers; and have
also given me access to the archives at Washington. They have recently ordered
a re-survey of the field, which is now being done by Government Engineers in
the most complete and scientific manner. A fine Topographical map is to be compiled
and engraved, copies of which I have arranged to have to illustrate my History
of the Battle. This book, in addition to the maps, which will cost several
thousand dollars, will also be illustrated with Steel Plates and Wood-Cuts in a
manner second to no book heretofore published in this country. Over $7,500
worth of illustrations are already engraved to embellish it, including fine Steel
Portraits, executed by the best engravers in America, in line and stipple, of
Generals Reynolds, Doubleday, Newton, Meredith, Stannard, Hancock, Gibbon,
Zook, Hays, Webb, Hall, Sickles, Birney, Humphreys, Berdan, Sykes, Barnes,
Tilton, Wright, Bartlett, Wheaton, Howard, Ames, Slocum, Williams, Geary,
Kane, Pleasanton, Butterfield, Warren, Hunt, Ingalls, Randolph, Martin, and McGilvrey.
Several others are in hand, and undoubtedly more will be added to the
list. In addition to these the Portraits of leading Confederate Generals will be
engraved. Many of the prominent scenes of the battle have already been beautifully
designed and engraved on wood, samples of which embellish this circular,
others are to be added, and to those interested I shall be pleased to furnish full
information regarding either portraits or wood-cuts.</p>

<p>I have now devoted five years and a half to collecting material for the history
of the Battle of Gettysburg, but until quite recently I have felt unwilling to commence
to write, knowing that other matter existed which it was important for me
to have, and which, when obtained, might make a material change in the account.
This reason no longer exists, though I shall still thankfully receive suggestions
from any participant in the battle.</p>

<p>Within another year the Government will have completed the Topographical
Map of the field, by which time I hope to be ready to publish my work. As a
publisher I would have done so long ago, but as a historian not until I feel that I
have written the truth&mdash;the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>

<p class="h5">PAINTINGS OF THE BATTLE.</p>

<p>I have also in progress, the finest Collection of Oil Paintings
executed of any battle in this country. The whole to be known as</p>

<p class="h5">
"THE GETTYSBURG ART GALLERY."<br />
</p>

<p>I have divided the Battle into a series of episodes, beginning with its commencement
and continuing to its close, each to embrace such movements and
operations as of themselves form a complete unit. Of each, I make an accurate
historical design, which design I place in the hands of some eminent battle-scene
painter, who will be responsible for the artistic rendering of the subject. Each
painting is to be 7 &times; 4 ft., and when completed, will be exhibited in the places
where the regiments represented in it were raised. The whole, together, will
form a most complete and graphic representation of the Battle from its commencement
to the close. Each of these paintings will be engraved on steel, and hereafter
engravings may be had representing actual scenes, which, having been
designed under the personal direction of the participants themselves, will possess
the merit of historical truth.</p>

<p>It must not be understood that this whole work is to be put in hand at once.
It will be taken up in detail, and continued as rapidly as I have time and means to
attend to it. I shall be happy to correspond with those interested in any portion
of the Battle. When convenient, it will be better to call a meeting, at Gettysburg,
of the officers of the command to be represented, before commencing a painting,
that all the details may be properly arranged. I have already made a design,
representing the "charge" of the 6th Wisconsin, 95th N. Y., and 14th N. Y.
S. M., on the first day, resulting in the capture of the 2d Mississippi Regiment,
which is now being painted by Alonzo Chappel, Esq., the eminent historical
painter. I have recently met, at Gettysburg, the officers of the 3d Division,
1st Army Corps, and under their direction completed a design of their engagement
on the afternoon of the first day, which will also embrace the movements
of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division. This picture is now being painted by the
distinguished battle-scene painter, James Walker, Esq.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker has just completed for me, his graphic representation of</p>

<p class="h5">
THE REPULSE OF LONGSTREET'S CHARGE,<br />
</p>

<p>on the afternoon of the third day, which will be exhibited in the principal cities
of the country. This is also from my historical design, and has been painted under
my immediate direction. Mr. Walker spent weeks at Gettysburg, transcribing
the portraiture of the field to canvas, which has been done in the most pleasing
and lifelike manner. We have received in this matter the kindest support and
co-operation of the officers of the army, engaged on that portion of the field.</p>

<p>Many distinguished general officers, on my invitation, visited Gettysburg, and
went over the field with us, and pointed out all the details of this great turning
point of the Rebellion; each explaining the movements of their several commands.
Among those present at different times, were Generals Meade, Hancock,
Gibbon, Howard, Doubleday, Stannard, Hunt, Warren, Humphreys, Graham,
Burling, De Trobriand, Wistar, and Dana; together with a large number of Field,
Line, and Staff-Officers. Most of these gentlemen have since kindly called at Mr.
Walker's studio, and aided the work with their advice. Many others, who were
unable to meet with us at Gettysburg, have, at considerable trouble, visited the
studio in New York; among them, Generals Webb, Hall, Newton, Hazard, Sickles,
Ward, Brewster, Berdan, and Gates, and Generals Wilcox and Longstreet, of the
Confederate Army; the latter taking great interest in the painting, and leaving
me a fine letter indorsing its accuracy. This painting has been designed <i>strictly</i>
in conformity to the directions of these gentlemen, given on the field for that
purpose, and from the Reports of the Confederate Commanders, furnished to me
by the Government.</p>

<p>This great representative Battle-scene has not its equal in America, for correctness
of design or accuracy of execution. Gibbon's and Hays's Divisions and
the Corps Artillery, occupy the immediate foreground. It is on a canvas 7-1/2 &times; 20
feet, and represents, not only every Regiment engaged at that portion of the field,
but where the formation of the ground would admit, the entire left wing is shown.</p>

<p>It presents such an accurate and lifelike portrait of the country, that on it
the movements of the first and second day's operations can readily be traced.
No important scene has been screened behind large foreground figures, or, for the
want of a knowledge of the details, hidden by convenient puffs of smoke; but
every feature of this gigantic struggle has, in its proper place, been woven into a
symmetrical whole.</p>

<p>A fine steel plate is also to be engraved of this picture, which will be accompanied
by a <i>Key</i>, by which the position of every Regiment and Battery can be
determined.</p>

<p class="h4">"THE LAST HOURS OF LINCOLN."</p>

<p class="h5">ORIGIN OF THIS HISTORICAL PAINTING.</p>

<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States, was assassinated by <span class="smcap">John Wilkes Booth</span> on
the night of April 14, 1865, at Ford's Theater, Washington, D. C. This night, fraught with woe to the
peoples of two continents, sombered by its halo of diabolism, must forever remain the Golgotha of American
history.</p>

<p>At the threshold of the temple of peace&mdash;the High Priest was stricken down&mdash;and the great heart
whose every throb was a pulsation of love for his country's enemies, was robed in silence. In company
with Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>, Miss <span class="smcap">Harris</span>, and Major <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> had sought a brief respite from the
iron wheel of State toil, and in the search, through the medium of the assassin's bullet, found a respite for
all time.</p>

<p>Immediately after the fatal shot was fired, and under direction of Assistant-Surgeons <span class="smcap">Leale</span> and
<span class="smcap">Taft</span>, he was removed to a private house, and placed upon a couch in a small bedroom. <span class="smcap">Robert Lincoln</span>,
General <span class="smcap">Todd</span>, and Dr. <span class="smcap">Todd</span>, cousins of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>, and other personal friends, speedily arrived. His
family physician, Dr. <span class="smcap">Stone</span>, and Surgeon-General <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>, accompanied by Asst.-Surgeon General <span class="smcap">Crane</span>,
were in early attendance, and later he was visited by Drs. <span class="smcap">Hall</span> and <span class="smcap">Liebermann</span>, and other eminent physicians,
all of whom agreed that the wound was unto death. The bullet had entered the back of his head,
and lodged behind the right eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> was visited during the night by Vice-President <span class="smcap">Johnson</span> and the entire cabinet, except
Mr. <span class="smcap">Seward</span>, including Secretaries <span class="smcap">McCulloch</span>, <span class="smcap">Stanton</span>, <span class="smcap">Welles</span>, and <span class="smcap">Usher</span>. Postmaster-General
<span class="smcap">Dennison</span>, and Attorney-General <span class="smcap">Speed</span>, together with Asst.-Secretaries <span class="smcap">Field</span>, <span class="smcap">Eckert</span>, and <span class="smcap">Otto</span>. There
were also present Speaker <span class="smcap">Colfax</span>, Chief-Justice <span class="smcap">Cartter</span>, Senator <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, Representatives <span class="smcap">Farnsworth</span>,
<span class="smcap">Arnold</span>, <span class="smcap">Marston</span>, and <span class="smcap">Rollins</span>, Governor <span class="smcap">Oglesby</span>, accompanied by Adjutant-General <span class="smcap">Haynie</span>, Major
<span class="smcap">Hay</span>, Generals <span class="smcap">Auger</span>, <span class="smcap">Meigs</span>, and <span class="smcap">Halleck</span>, Ex-Governor <span class="smcap">Farwell</span>, Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Gurley</span>, and Commissioner
<span class="smcap">French</span>, Colonels <span class="smcap">Vincent Pelouze</span> and <span class="smcap">Rutherford</span>, and Major <span class="smcap">Rockwell</span>. Early in the night Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> sent for Mrs. Senator <span class="smcap">Dixon</span>, who was accompanied by her sister and niece, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Kinney</span> and
daughter. There were also a few others present during the night, but never more than half of those
represented on the painting at any one time.</p>

<p>By the publicity of the assassination it was soon known throughout the city, and thousands crowded
the avenues leading to the house where the President lay.</p>

<p>The news of this tragic event flashed with the speed of lightning throughout the land. From Maine to
California consternation reigned, and feelings of surprise and grief were depicted on every face. The great
man now martyred had for more than four years held the highest place in the gift of the American people,
and on him their hopes had centered. The designer of the painting of</p>

<p class="h5">
"THE LAST HOURS OF LINCOLN,"<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jno. B. Bachelder</span>, arrived in Washington on the night of his death, and being impressed with the
historic importance of the event, at once determined to collect such materials as should be necessary for an
historical picture commemorating that sad scene, and should the demand warrant it, to publishing a steel-plate
engraving from it. The design for the painting was soon completed, and arrangements having been
made with <span class="smcap">Brady &amp; Co</span>., Photographers, as soon as the remains of the President left the city each of the
persons represented were visited, and at their convenience were <i>posed</i> and photographed in the position
which they now occupy in the painting. It being important that the best possible original should be had
for the engraver's use, the design was placed in the hands of <span class="smcap">Alonzo Chapel</span>, Esq., the historical painter,
to whose genius the painting is to be credited. Much of its completeness is due to the kindness and attention
of the persons represented; as all cheerfully gave their time for frequent sittings, both to the designer
and painter.</p>

<p>No expense has been spared to produce a work worthy the scene it represents, and the high encomiums
given it by eminent judges is the best proof of the result.</p>

<p>To publish any thing now short of a first-class copy of such a painting would be a breach of confidence
to those who have so kindly aided in its production. The proprietor has therefore decided to have this
picture engraved in the finest style of line and stipple, the engraved surface of the plate to be 18 &times; 31
inches; believing that nothing short of a <i>genuine work of art</i> will meet the approval, and secure the
patronage of the American people, and to those interested the proprietor can most confidently promise a
suitable memento of their departed chief.</p>

<p>The engraving is being executed by <span class="smcap">H. B. Hall</span>, Jr., Esq., the eminent engraver upon steel.</p>

<p>A great picture has been designed of the "Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln." The designer is Mr. John
B. Bachelder, the painter Alonzo Chappel. * * The value of such a picture of such a scene is enormous,
and of a kind to ever increase with time. * * Looking like himself, from his finger-nails to his hard,
protruding lip, Stanton, with paper and pencil in hand, and uplifted forefinger, is giving instructions to the
soldierly General Auger, the then Military Commander of the District. * * Portraits so minutely like
I have never seen, even from the brush of Elliot. * * *</p>

<p>The grandeur in the face of Lincoln, is grand indeed. The cold hues of death are warmed to the eye by
the red rays of a candle held over him, and the flickering flare causing a Rembrandt-like effect, is very
felicitously managed. The eye rests in love and pity on it, turning from those around impatiently. * * *</p>

<p>McCulloch who turns from the scene, and Johnson who sits in the left foreground, are wonderfully like.
As is the erect Dennison beyond them; and Meigs, with his hand resting on the door-post, where he stood
to prevent disturbing entrances; Dr. Stone and Surgeon-General Barnes, General Todd, Judge Otto,
Sumner, Farnsworth, Speaker Colfax, and Governor Oglesby, are looking down on the face of Lincoln with
an expression of respectful concern. * * * Judge Cartter and Ex-Governor Farwell stand in front of
Meigs, forming the right foreground of the picture; they are given in profile and seem conversing.</p>

<p>The greatness of the picture lies in its correct transcription of an actual scene and perfect portraiture
of American men. It is just such a work as, above all others, should be American property, for if ever
there was a <i>National</i> picture, this is one.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
